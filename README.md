### Ponzi aspect

* [Financial Times: Why bitcoin is worse than a Madoff-style Ponzi scheme](https://web.archive.org/web/20220113183816/https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/rm78e3/financial_times_why_bitcoin_is_worse_than_a/) - 2021-12-22. A Ponzi scheme is a zero-sum enterprise. But bitcoin is a negative-sum phenomenon that you can’t even pursue a claim against, argues Robert McCauley.

  > Once upon a time in Albania, a scrappy, alternative finance industry emerged to take on and eventually supplant a sclerotic, technologically-backward banking system. The lessons from its dramatic collapse remain relevant today. 
  >
  > Essentially, what was initially touted as a post-communist entrepreneurial success story proved to be pyramid schemes of breathtaking proportions. Slick marketing and lofty promises turned an informal, decentralised, crime-facilitating ecosystem into a mainstream mania that sucked in multitudes of people, unchecked by feeble and fitful regulatory warnings.

### Scams/frauds

* [People Building ‘Blockchain City’ in Wyoming Scammed by Hackers - Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7w3am/people-building-blockchain-city-in-wyoming-scammed-by-hackers) - - 2022-01-12 - On Monday, CityDAO—the group that bought 40 acres of Wyoming in hopes of "building a city on the Ethereum blockchain”—announced that its Discord server was hacked and members' funds were successfully stolen as a result.

### DAOs

* [Is The DAO going to be DOA?](https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@dan/is-the-dao-going-to-be-doa) - 2016-05-16 - by Dan Larimer (founder of BitShares and much else). Larimer sets out most of the basic critiques of DAOs as governance innovation extremely well:
  > Fancy technology can obscure our assessment of what is really going on. The DAO solves a single problem: the corrupt trustee or administrator. It replaces voluntary compliance with a corporation’s charter under threat of lawsuit, with automated compliance with software defined rules. This subtle change may be enough to bypass regulatory hurdles facing traditional trustee’s and administrators, but it doesn’t solve most of the problems the regulations were attempting to address.
  > 
  > What The DAO doesn’t solve is all of the other problems inherent with any joint venture. These are people problems, economic problems, and political problems. In some sense, The DAO creates many new problems caused by its ridged rules and expensive machine-enforced process for change.
  >
  > The DAO doesn’t solve the “group trap” where by losers subsidize winners. It disempowers the individual actor and forces him to submit to group decision making. It doesn’t make raising money cheaper for companies, it just adds blockchain-enforced bureaucratic and political processes.

Tether is the largest stablecoin, and the primary driver of volume and liquidity. Bitfinex used to be the largest cryptocurrency exchange, and still is a frequently used exchange.

## Iron-manning the pro arguments

Here we collect the best theses for why this is important/interesting/world-changing.

### Fat protocols

From https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/

> The previous generation of shared protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.) produced immeasurable amounts of value, but most of it got captured and re-aggregated on top at the applications layer, largely in the form of data (think Google, Facebook and so on). The Internet stack, in terms of how value is distributed, is composed of “thin” protocols and “fat” applications.
>
> This relationship between protocols and applications is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer. It’s a stack with “fat” protocols and “thin” applications.

* [Crypto Tokens and the Coming Age of Protocol Innovation](https://continuations.com/post/148098927445/crypto-tokens-and-the-age-of-protocol-innovation) - 2016-07-28 - by Albert Wenger at USV. Move about incentivizing investment in the protocols
* [Fat Protocols](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) - Aug 2016 - Joel Monegro at USV - more about incentivizing adoption

### Fairer governance

Can support more democratic, distributed governance, e.g. cooperatives (somehow). Can save Democracy.

* [If I Only had a Heart: a DisCO Manifesto](https://disco.coop/manifesto/) - Dec 2019 - A joint publication by DisCO.coop, the Transnational Institute and Guerrilla Media Collective. "Value Sovereignty, Care Work, Commons and Distributed Cooperative Organizations. The DisCO Manifesto is a deep dive into the world of Distributed Cooperative Organizations. Over its 80 colorful pages, you will read about how DisCOs are a P2P/Commons, cooperative and Feminist Economic alternative to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The DisCO Manifesto also includes some background on topics like blockchain, AI, the commons, feminism, cooperatives, cyberpunk, and more."
* [Wired: The Father of Web3 Wants You to Trust Less](https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/) - 2021-11-29 - Gavin Wood, who coined the term Web3 in 2014, believes decentralized technologies are the only hope of preserving liberal democracy.

### Fairer Economy

* [Li Jin on the future of the creator economy](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/li-jin-on-the-future-of-the-creator-economy) - Shared ownership and control of online platforms is the way forward (via crypto)
  * The irony here is we want the outcome, it's just that crypto is neither necessary nor likely to get us there. See https://rufuspollock.com/fixing-facebook/
