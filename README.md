### Ponzi Aspect

* [Financial Times: Why bitcoin is worse than a Madoff-style Ponzi scheme](https://web.archive.org/web/20220113183816/https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/rm78e3/financial_times_why_bitcoin_is_worse_than_a/) - 2021-12-22. A Ponzi scheme is a zero-sum enterprise. But bitcoin is a negative-sum phenomenon that you can’t even pursue a claim against, argues Robert McCauley.

  > Once upon a time in Albania, a scrappy, alternative finance industry emerged to take on and eventually supplant a sclerotic, technologically-backward banking system. The lessons from its dramatic collapse remain relevant today. 
  >
  > Essentially, what was initially touted as a post-communist entrepreneurial success story proved to be pyramid schemes of breathtaking proportions. Slick marketing and lofty promises turned an informal, decentralised, crime-facilitating ecosystem into a mainstream mania that sucked in multitudes of people, unchecked by feeble and fitful regulatory warnings.

Long article and could fit under multiple headings here.
