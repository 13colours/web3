# Introduction

## What This Is

This initiative is an exploration of the ideations of crypto and "web3" and its constituent technologies, aspirations and economics. The concept of [web3](/concepts/web3.md) is a fuzzy term often accused of being a buzzword that can be hard to make sense of, this initiative aims to address the misunderstandings and shed a light on basic macroeconomics and technology for those tasked with doing sense-making for the public. Our [methodology](/guide/method.md) aims to create a balanced and moderate perspective that incorporates ideas from conventional macroeconomics, political economy and computer science.
