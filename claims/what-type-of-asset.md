# What type of assets are crypto token?

Crypto assets are [securities](../concepts/security.md) contracts.

See the [assets](../concepts/assets.md) comparison chart for an overview of how crypto asset compare to traditional investments and currencies.

Crypto assets are [not currency](is-bitcoin-currency.md) because they cannot fulfil the definition of [money](../concepts/money.md).

Crypto assets are not [commodities](../concepts/commodity.md) because they have no intrinsic value needed to fulfil any productive economic activity or human need. Their definition of [use-value](../concepts/use-value.md) depends on a circular argument.

Crypto assets may also be a form of [art](../concepts/art.md) under the fuzzy definition of "artistic intent".
