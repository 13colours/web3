# Crypto has a weird subculture
Crypto currency is an example of a self-organizing [high control group](../concepts/high-control-group.md) whose existence organically creates a market mania, [bubble](../concepts/bubble.md) and [narrative economics](../concepts/narrative-economics.md) that entices the public to invest in the asset class or join the group and its subculture.

Since the asset class is [non-productive](../concepts/productive-asset.md) and [negative-sum](negative-sum.md)the crypto scheme depends largely on narratives of "money for nothing" and "easy wealth" that clash with traditional readings of [economics](../concepts/ideologies/keynsian-economics.md). These schemes may depend on [technosolutionism](../concepts/ideologies/technosolutionism.md) or [libertarianism](../concepts/ideologies/libertarianism.md) to justify bringing more [greater fools](../concepts/greater-fool-theory.md) into the scheme.

Crypto culture depends heavily on a distortion of language to signify belonging to an ingroup and leans heavily on [thought terminating cliches](../concepts/thought-terminating-cliches.md) to quell dissent or rational discourse.
