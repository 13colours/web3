# Crypto has a weird subculture
Crypto currency is an example of a [high-control-group](../concepts/high-control-group.md) to develop the [narrative-economics](../concepts/narrative-economics.md) to entice people to invest in the asset class. Since the asset class is [negative-sum](negative-sum.md) it depends largely on inconsistent narratives that clash with orthodox [economics](../concepts/ideologies/keynsian-economics.md) and depend on [technosolutionism](../concepts/ideologies/technosolutionism.md) to justify bringing more [greater fools](../concepts/greater-fool-theory.md) into the scheme.

Crypto culture depends heavily on a distortion of language to signify belonging to an ingroup and leans heavily on [thought terminating cliches](../concepts/thought-terminating-cliches.md) to quell dissent or rational discourse.
