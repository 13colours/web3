# Crypto has a weird subculture
The crypto subculture is an example of a self-organizing [high control group](../concepts/high-control-group.md) whose existence organically creates a market mania, [bubble](../concepts/bubble.md) and [narrative economics](../concepts/narrative-economics.md) that entices the public to invest in the asset class or join the group and its subculture.

Since the asset class is [non-productive](../concepts/productive-asset.md) and [negative-sum](negative-sum.md) the crypto scheme entirely depends on attracting new investor inflows based on narratives of "money for nothing" and "easy wealth" that clash with traditional readings of [economics](../concepts/ideologies/keynsian-economics.md). These schemes may also depend on [technosolutionism](../concepts/ideologies/technosolutionism.md) or [libertarianism](../concepts/ideologies/libertarianism.md) to justify bringing more [greater fools](../concepts/greater-fool-theory.md) into the scheme.

Crypto culture depends heavily on a distortion of language to signify belonging to an ingroup and leans heavily on [thought terminating cliches](../concepts/thought-terminating-cliches.md) to quell dissent and rational discourse. Within the crypto [subculture](../claims/weird-culture.md) there are several thought-terminating cliches.

* "have fun staying poor" / "hfsp"
* "If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you"
* "we're all going to make" / "wagmi"
* "hold on for dear life" / "hodl"
* "the dollar is a ponzi scheme" / everything is a ponzi"
* "now do the dollar"
* "FUD"
* "few understand"
* "bullish"
* "to the moon"
* "diamond hands"
