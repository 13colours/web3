# Austrian Economics

A heterodox school of economics that attempts to reason about human behaviour from first principles and deductive reasoning instead of quantitative analysis. Popular in the early 20th century but largely rejected by the modern academy. 

This school of thought has seen a resurgence in relation to cryptocurrency.

Often resonates with advocacy for the [gold-standard](gold-standard.md) and [libertarianism](libertarianism.md).
