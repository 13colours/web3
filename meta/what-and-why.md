Intention: deep collective "[sensemaking](sensemaking.md)" on crypto, web3 etc.

Sensemaking = making sense of it. Intellectually, emotionally etc.

Collective  = ...

Deep = it takes significant time to dig into and explain this topics properly. Deep also in the sense of correctly nested and structured so that is explorable

Why do this: people struggle to understand this stuff. It seems complex and confusing. End up throwing up their hands. There is a growing set of critique but as a complex subject it can seem overwhelming. There's no authoritative walkthrough of the issues as far as i know - lots of good stuff but disparate. (esp that iron-mans the pro arguments and pulls out the overall aspirations)
