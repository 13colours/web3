# Get a Roadmap v0.1

What & Why: We want a clear near-term roadmap with associated tasks so that

* we know what to prioritize
* have goals (to inspire us)
* can efficiently self-organize in a distributed, part-time and part-volunteer team

## Acceptance

A clear near-term (1m) roadmap and a vaguer 6m roadmap in [plan](../plan.md)

* [ ] Backlog
* [ ] Prioritization
  * [ ] Milestones / Goals
  * [ ] Rough timeline
* [ ] Next actions

### Meta (how we organize)

* [x] Team structure
  * [x] Scrum Lead **‚úÖ Eilidh**
  * [x] Product Owner **‚úÖ Rufus**
* [x] Team process
  * [x] Clear PM infrastructure e.g. where are we ...
    * [x] Recording meeting notes **‚úÖ ?? GDocs?**
    * [x] Recording actions and tasks. Options are: github issues, planning docs in wiki, gdocs, spreadsheet (e.g. issue tree)? **‚úÖ Github issues for day to day tasks. May do larger "epic/project" planning in `meta` section of wiki. Finally, Issue tree spreadsheet provides overview and we will attach tasks to items there**
  * [x] Can we do all the work "in the open"? **Pretty much. For some job stories or interviews may need to record privately and process before sharing**
  * [x] Are we doing iterations and of what form? **‚úÖ Yes, we are going to do 2 week iterations.**
* [x] Materials
  * [x] Where is the primary location for materials etc e.g. are we using markdown/hackmd/git/obsidian or gdocs? **‚úÖ consolidate on the wiki (markdown + github) using coggle only to provide overviews or brainstorm. More discussion below. For drafting people can use whatever they are comfortable with**
  * [x] Existing materials are tidied up (e.g. PA10) **‚úÖ 2022-03-11 DONE except for job stories**

## Tasks

* [x] Prep
* [x] Background reading
* [ ] Backlog and prioritization

* [ ] fill in issue tree answers

### Brainstorm and Organize üëà

üö© already have issue tree and plan.md - do we need to do more and if so where ...

Brainstorming major next steps

* [ ] library integration
* [ ] guide - https://github.com/life-itself/web3/issues/77
  * [ ] ‚è© review current status and what remains to be done
* [ ] post existing materials
* [ ] tech side

Re the claims

Outcome vision

* [ ] A page for each major claim in the taxonomy
  * [ ] The evaluation progress of each claim
  * [ ] The evaluation (e.g. true/false)
  * [ ] Aspirations it links to
  * [ ] Who's making it and where (big egs)

Random

* [ ] A page for the major episodes we've done as the landing page for them separate from the youtube
  * [ ] Where do these go? **‚úÖ `/notes/`**
  * [ ] Do we flag them into news somehow? **üöß someday**


### Simplification of tools and process for content

H: Consolidate and simplify material and structure => consolidate on the wiki using coggle only to provide overviews or brainstorm.

Why?

* S+C: using 3+ locations atm and several tools
  * we have google docs (docs & sheets), git, coggle, excalidraw etc
  * Markdown in github (with obsidian)
  * coggle
  * even core team members a bit confused over all the locations of stuff
* Want to get clear on what we use for what.
* H: consolidate on the wiki using coggle only to provide overviews or brainstorm.
  * What about meeting notes etc?

Concrete example: aspirations and claims "database" => see the next item.

### Consolidate our claims database stuff in one place

Currently have 4 locations for claims. We want to consolidate on one.

* [x] Consolidate overview of the aspirations/claims
  * [x] What are current locations? ‚úÖ **2022-03-10 currently 4 locations: In Issue Tree spreadsheet a) "Claims" b) "Aspirations and Claims"; then also c) https://coggle.it/diagram/YhTzF8ZnKihmLdpm/t/web3-taxonomy-of-aspirations-and-claims d) claims list in wiki https://github.com/life-itself/web3/tree/main/claims here**
  * [x] Choose location for overall list ‚úÖ **Consolidate on coggle https://coggle.it/diagram/YhTzF8ZnKihmLdpm/t/web3-taxonomy-of-aspirations-and-claims (for now as of 2022-03-10) as the best version. Next would be to converge with wiki**
  * [x] Move brainstorm of aspirations/claims from gdocs to the coggle ‚úÖ **there was only fairer and stable economy section and most already there so not much to move. Have deleted from gdocs**
  * [x] Move from apirations & claims spreadsheet **‚úÖ All already there**
  * [x] Consolidate wiki list https://github.com/life-itself/web3/tree/main/claims to coggle
    * [ ] 
* [x] Consolidate on a page on the wiki as focal location
  * [x] Create the index page
  * [x] Where? `/claims/`
  * [x] Do we embed the coggle? ‚úÖ Yes, at least to start with
  * [x] Do we list on index page the other claim pages in the wiki (and how)? ‚úÖ **For now we won't. In future we can use our CMS system to do so.**

### Misc

* [ ] üîΩ2Ô∏è‚É£ Process job stories brainstorm somewhere https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AV2xXDgTiNRVv6_M7CoGhiFl8pBj5hDGi_qdsHOU_3M/edit#heading=h.g248tv329855
  * [ ] Where? ‚úÖ **`meta/job-stories` in the wiki and just remove any identifying info from user interviews**
  * [ ] Why? ‚úÖ **Job stories help us prioritize our efforts (plus motivation for ourselves and others as to why we are doing this). E.g. if we know what journalists are looking for X we can focus on that which seems a high impact thing to do.**
  * [ ] What are questions / topics we should write about?
    * A useful tool which collects google searches people are making about web3: https://answerthepublic.com/reports/54ce111d-ff4f-49fa-b2de-411695bd9910 These would make useful titles or section headings in blog posts about Web3.
