## How do we support [Sensemaking](../meta/sensemaking.md)?

How do we support the "making sense" of others ie. how do we share what we are doing?

Ans: See the diagram and discussion below. In short, We are creating a "base" sense-making layer that people can then reference (and, even in near term, can start saving Stephen time / become a useful resource for journalists)

### Our Approach to Sensemaking and Why It Matters

#todo/writing write this up in a coherent essay

- Crypto like climate change and vaccination in representing a breakdown / challenge to sensemaking
  - Controversial and talks to underlying ideological positions
- Collective sense-making seems ever more important
- Getting harder for various reasons: growing complexity, decline in trust / authority
- Here we set out what we are trying to do that may be a bit different and we think offer real value
- Need the underlying web of concepts and theses
  - AND a map of that space so as not to be overwhelmed
- AND connection of those concepts and theses to the day to day sensemaking in journalism, on twitter etc.
  - Need to go down to basics, need to get into capital formation, econ 101. How does the stock market work? 
  - This is bad, but everything is bad - that’s what we need to deconstruct. Lumped into an ontological blob of nothingness. The danger of the nihilist position. Or the leftist position - everything in capitalism is bad. 
    - Epistemological (leading to moral) nihilism
    - "Everything's a scam"  
    - "There’s nothing or there’s only power"
