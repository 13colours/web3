## On [sensemaking](../meta/sensemaking.md) - Outflow

What is the context and idea of sensemaking ...

Why this project in its particular form (given there is already a lot of "noise" and writing in this space)

Going a layer down from the SCQH into ...

- Why is sensemaking hard?
  - Why in general
  - Why in this area?
- Is it hard in this area? (what evidence is there that it is)
  - claim: there is a high level of disagreement
- Why is there so much noise ...

Hypothesis: (crude) when sensemaking working => we converge on truth

- Agreement & truth: align on X and X is "truth"
- Or, at least, we align on the essence of our disagreement (double cruxing)

To illustrate: you and I disagree about XXX

One option is we both realize we are talking about the same thing with different terms and actually agree.

The other is we realize we genuinely have a difference and it is because I care about fairness and you can care about freedom.
