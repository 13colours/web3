### Latest release section

* [ ] Where do the Latest Release go to?
  * [ ] What are options?
    * Directly to YouTube
    * To a page on our site
  * [ ] Which do we choose? ✅ **To a page on our site** because we then have a permalink for that item and we don't repeat ourselves in too many places and we can add much more context e.g. transcript of the item.
  * [ ] Where does that page live?
  * [ ] How do we pull those pages into the front page?
    * hard code
    * select automatically => have some kind of flag and then being able to select for that.
