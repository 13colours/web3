# Get Involved

This is an open collaborative project. We already have a variety of partners and contributors and we'd love to have more! Here are some of the ways you can get involved:

* Contribute to the [library][], for example by adding articles and research on web3 and background topics.
* Write up key concepts and ideas. You can check out our [existing list][concepts] to see which ones could be extended or improved.
* Proof edit articles and transcribe dialogs. Please [get in touch][contact] to find out more.
* Share the work with others.

Weâ€™d also love to have feedback through [our forum][forum]. For example:

* Are there particular topics or areas you think we should cover?
* Do you disagree with any of our assessments? Have we missed or misunderstood something?
* Do you have feedback on how we structure or present the thinking?
