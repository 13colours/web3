						<td>There is a growing empirical literature on Bitcoin and gold 
safe haven properties with respect to financial risks and macroeconomic 
news but very scarce literature regarding geopolitical risks. This paper
 provides a fresh insight into the Bitcoin safe haven status, in 
comparison to gold. We, first, propose a geopolitical risk composite 
indicator based on various sources of geopolitical risks. A Principal 
Component Analysis is conducted to group the information on these 
indicators. Second, a dynamic Markov-switching copula model (which 
accommodates a dynamic link between the developed geopolitical risk 
index and Bitcoin and gold price dynamics within low and high risk 
regimes) is used. We show that both Bitcoin and gold respond positively 
to the composite geopolitical risk indicator when risk is high. This 
underscores that both Bitcoin and gold have the ability to act as safe 
havens for assets whose valuations plummet during times of violent 
geopolitical conflicts. But such properties seem to be conditional upon 
different categories of geopolitical risks.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Bitcoin is an innovative technological network, a new, 
non-governmental currency, and a worldwide group of users. In other 
words, Bitcoin is a complex sociotechnical system with a complex set of 
risks and challenges for anyone using it. We investigated how everyday 
users of Bitcoin develop trust in Bitcoin on one of the largest online 
communities devoted to Bitcoin: the Reddit.com r/bitcoin forum. Using 
qualitative content analysis, we examined how trust in Bitcoin develops 
based on contributions to this community. On r/bitcoin, trust in Bitcoin
 is driven by a pervasive ideology we call the “True Bitcoiner” 
ideology. This ideological viewpoint in centered on the interpretation 
of Bitcoin as functionally “trustless” and risk-free. Despite widespread
 evidence of emerging individual and system-level risks with using 
Bitcoin, participants continue to maintain this ideological perspective.
 This ideology consists of three primary beliefs: viewing Bitcoin's 
technology as more trustworthy than its people; rejecting ‘corrupt' 
social hierarchies related to money; and the importance of accumulating 
or ‘HODLing' quantities of Bitcoin as a strategy to create an ideal 
future. We conclude that this “True Bitcoiner” ideology is maintained 
despite contradictory evidence in the world because it allows 
participants to more easily interpret Bitcoin and make decisions by 
reducing perceived risk and uncertainty in the system. The role of this 
ideology on r/bitcoin demonstrates an expanded conceptualization of how 
trust is created and socially-mediated in socio-technical contexts.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with 
exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social 
organization on and offline. Governing these Internet platforms and 
other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and 
managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or 
theory of institutional design. The dominant guiding practices for the 
design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, 
computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have
 been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing 
atheoretical approaches such as emulation, A/B-testing, engagement 
maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. One institutional 
analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional 
institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, 
particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and 
environmental and political scientists focused around the work of Elinor
 Ostrom, known collectively as the “Ostrom Workshop.” A key finding from
 this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design 
of many digital institutions is the importance of including 
participatory change mechanisms in what is called a “constitutional 
layer” of institutional design. The institutional rules that compose a 
constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing
 process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent 
consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in 
three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis 
informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such 
highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of 
constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain technology has enabled a new kind of distributed 
systems. Beyond its early applications in Finance, it has also allowed 
the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most
 relevant of these are the so-called Decentralized Autonomous 
Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems 
to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a
 result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing
 the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire 
people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the 
last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, 
have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds 
of these new organizations have appeared, with their communities 
interacting mediated by blockchain. However, the literature has yet to 
appropriately explore empirically this phenomena. In this paper, we aim 
to shed light on the current state of the DAO ecosystem. We review the 
three main platforms nowadays (Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus) which 
facilitate the creation and management of DAOs. Thus, we introduce their
 main differences, and compare them using quantitative metrics. For such
 comparison, we retrieve data from both the main Ethereum network 
(mainnet) and a parallel Ethereum network (xDai). We analyze data from 
72,320 users and 2,353 DAO communities in order to study the three 
ecosystems across four dimensions: growth, activity, voting system and 
funds. Our results show that there are notable differences among the DAO
 platforms in terms of growth and activity, and also in terms of voting 
results. Still, we consider that our work is only a first step and that 
further research is needed to better understand these communities, and 
evaluate their level of accomplishment in reaching decentralized 
governance.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Summary The disruptive nature of blockchain technology has 
drawn considerable interest from different types of stakeholders. It is 
adopted in numerous sectors with the ability to openly and securely 
verify, track, and exchange data. The energy blockchain, a term used 
when blockchain technology is applied in the energy sector, is 
considered as having the potential to develop a decentralized, 
digitized, and decarbonized energy management system. The article 
presents an overview of the development progress from three 
perspectives, including academic research, the deployment of companies 
and pilot projects, and government support policies. Then a different 
taxonomy is developed to demonstrate and highlighted the different 
applications. Finally, the future trends and challenges hindering the 
effective implementation of energy blockchain are discussed. The results
 show that energy blockchain is an effective innovation technology to 
accelerate the transformation of global energy structure. Multinational 
cooperation and government-leading are the basis of large-scale 
deployment of energy blockchain. The improvement of regulatory 
mechanisms and standards is the key to the commercial application of 
energy blockchain. This study is a comprehensive analysis of energy 
blockchain applications, which is expected to support decision making 
for its future development.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>A digital institution is a set of computer-based rules that 
perform intermediating roles upon which one or more person's well-being 
depends. This article argues that governance, the processes and customs 
by which rules are agreed, is critical to the sustainability of the 
digital institution and therefore of society more broadly. The objective
 of this work was to interrogate whether emerging decentralised 
architectures (blockchain) can offer new perspectives on digital 
sustainability in the form of decentralised governance. Firstly, the 
literature on decentralised modes of governance was synthesised. Then, 
existing digital institutions were reviewed, categorised and mapped onto
 a multi-domain layered conceptual framework that draws out three 
distinct modes for enactment of changes to digital institution rules; 
direct, integrated, and fork-based. We concluded that the coupling of 
decentralised governance approaches with fork-based or integrated 
enactment stands to enhance digital sustainability through increased 
perception of trustworthiness afforded through independently verifiable 
and cryptographically secure audit trails.</td>

			<h2>A history of crypto-discourse: encryption as a site of struggles to define internet freedom</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper explores a history of “crypto” as a battlefield in a
 larger discursive struggle to define the meaning of Internet freedom. 
The term crypto is short for cryptography, which refers to the practice 
of encrypting, i.e. rendering information illegible to anyone but its 
intended recipient(s). Drawing on Laclau and Mouffe's theory of 
discourse, this study investigates how public-key cryptography 
advocates, and in particular Cypherpunks and technology journalists, 
have articulated “crypto-discourse”: a partially fixed construction of 
meaning that establishes a relationship between encryption software and a
 negative conception of Internet freedom, in relation to the state. I 
map events pertaining to the articulation of the empty signifier 
“crypto” among interrelated discourse communities of cryptographers, 
hackers, online rights activists, and technology journalists during a 
period of forty years (1975–2015). I present the Crypto-Discourse 
Timeline as comprised of three periods: the origins (1975–1990), 
crystallisation (1990–2000), and revitalisation of crypto-discourse 
(2000–2015). The timeline provides an overview of the complexity and 
contingency of crypto-discourse as a practice that shapes public policy 
over time. Crypto-discourse excludes other possible, positive meanings 
of Internet freedom, removing responsibility from democratic states to 
uphold privacy rights and freedom of speech online.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article examines the connectedness and information 
spillover in the Electricity-Crypto Network (ECN) system. The Bitcoin 
and Ethereum markets are studied due to the level of electricity demand 
for active trading and mining in the three leading crypto mining 
economies (United States, China, and Japan). Among other findings, the 
leading net transmitter of information is the return of the Bitcoin 
market while the demand for electricity in the U.S. and Japan are the 
leading net information receivers in the ECN system. In a nutshell, the 
return and trading volumes of the cryptocurrency markets are net 
information transmitters while the markets' volatility and the demand 
for electricity in the U.S., China, and Japan are net information 
receivers in the system. As a policy relevance, given the favourable 
developments in these crypto markets, greener sources of electrical 
energy are expedient to mitigate emissions while mining these coins. 
This will reduce the impact of human activities on the climate.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>We show that cryptocurrency markets are plagued by 
pump-and-dump manipulation, with at least 355 cases in seven months. 
Unlike stock market manipulators, cryptocurrency manipulators openly 
declare their intentions to pump specific coins, rather than trying to 
deceive investors. Puzzlingly, people join in despite negative expected 
returns. In a simple framework, we demonstrate how overconfidence and 
gambling preferences can explain participation in these schemes and find
 strong empirical support for both mechanisms. Pumps generate extreme 
price distortions of 65% on average, abnormal trading volumes in the 
millions of dollars, and large wealth transfers between participants. 
These manipulation schemes are likely to persist as long as regulators 
and exchanges turn a blind eye.</td>

Puzzlingly, people join in despite negative expected returns. [..] Analyzing a sample of 355 cases in six months, we find strong empirical support for both mechanisms. Pumps generate extreme price distortions of 65% on average, abnormal trading volumes in the millions of dollars, and large wealth transfers between participants.</span></em></p>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain has been receiving growing attention from both 
academia and practices. This paper aims to investigate the research 
status of blockchain-related studies and to analyze the development and 
evolution of this latest hot area via bibliometric analysis. We selected
 and explored 2451 papers published between 2013 and 2019 from the Web 
of Science Core Collection database. The analysis considers different 
dimensions, including annual publications and citation trends, author 
distribution, popular research themes, collaboration of countries 
(regions) and institutions, top papers, major publication journals 
(conferences), supportive funding agencies, and emerging research 
trends. The results show that the number of blockchain literature is 
still increasing, and the research priorities in blockchain-related 
research shift during the observation period from bitcoin, 
cryptocurrency, blockchain, smart contract, internet of thing, to the 
distributed ledger, and challenge and the inefficiency of blockchain. 
The findings of this research deliver a holistic picture of blockchain 
research, which illuminates the future direction of research, and 
provides implications for both academic research and enterprise 
practice.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This essay aims to correct the established idea that the 
cypherpunk movement was organically embracing libertarianism. By 
addressing the cypherpunk movement, the intellectual roots of many of 
the concerns about freedom and about a surveillance society that 
dominate this internet age come to light. The cypherpunks, a heterogenic
 group of entrepreneurs, engineers, and activists in the San Francisco 
Bay Area, argued in the nineties that the Internet would make more 
pervasive the phenomenon of surveillance of individuals. In the context 
of this increasing process of surveillance, individual autonomy would be
 dismissed as an obsolete fiction and social engineering would be 
elevated to totalitarianism. This article frames the cypherpunks as a 
movement in opposition to an emerging technocratic authoritarian order.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Global financial and data capitalism has constituted new forms
 of knowledge, novel inscriptions which make that knowledge tangible and
 new ways of visualizing sources of value and profit. This paper 
examines a cluster of new practices designed to make visible - and 
extract value from - those without formal credit scores in contemporary 
financial markets. Many 'financial inclusion' projects now attempt to 
score the 'credit invisible' by drawing on a range of alternative data -
 non-financial payment streams, academic records, behavioural signals 
gleaned from online or social media footprints and results generated via
 digitized psychometric testing - and by assessing that data in relation
 to models of risk assessment based on the analysis of big data. I argue
 in this paper that these experiments in alternative credit scoring 
constitute the unbanked as an important, and dubious, category of 
knowledge and intervention. I also argue that attempts to score the 
unbanked offer a revealing glimpse of many of the social and political 
limitations associated with projects of 'inclusion'. Although often 
imagined as forms of pristine incorporation, inclusion projects often 
constitute troubling new kinds of social sorting and segmentation.</td>

 distributed ledger called a blockchain. There has been increasing legal
 interest in the application of these self-executing programs to conduct
 transactions. Most of the scholarly and practical analysis so far has 
been taken the claims of this technology being akin to a contract at 
face value, with legal analysis of contract formation, performance, and 
enforcement at the forefront of the debate. This article discusses that 
while smart contracts may pose some interesting legal questions, most of
 these are irrelevant, and smart contracts should be understood almost 
strictly from a technical perspective, and that any legal response is 
entirely dependent on the technical capabilities of the smart contract. 
The article proposes that smart contracts are not contracts for all 
practical purposes.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Alternative currencies have appeared regularly for at least 
the last half-millennia, often arising out of similar socio-economic 
circumstances and ceasing to circulate within a relatively short time 
period. While regulatory shifts and technology shocks account for some 
of the challenges alternative currencies have faced in gaining wider 
adoption, the most common observed explanation for why alternative 
currencies decline is insufficient demand due to relatively high 
transaction costs, low institutional support, inconsistent social 
motivation, and other factors. Present-day alternative currencies, such 
as the Brixton pound, are similar to past alternative currencies, while 
bitcoin features several radical differences.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>We utilize one of the earliest and largest NFT collections to 
investigate the pricing and the risk-return profile of NFTs. In general,
 we find that NFTs have higher returns than traditional financial 
assets. Yet, investing in NFTs comes along with extremely high 
volatility. The average monthly returns on NFTs range from 6.10% to 
44.11%. But their standard deviations fluctuate between 44.35% and 
74.57%, leading to a Sharpe ratio comparable to the NASDAQ index. NFT 
prices surge when there is a drastic increase in demand for alternative 
investments and a search for yield, especially in a low interest rate 
environment. We also find that the pricing of NFT largely depends on a 
token's scarceness and an investor's aesthetic preference. Hence, 
conventional asset-pricing models are unlikely to explain NFT returns. 
Overall, we provide the first comprehensive analysis that NFTs serve as a
 novel investment vessel in this Fintech era. JEL Classifications: C43,

			<h2>American Finance and American Democracy: Towards an Institutionalist 'Law and Economics'</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article reconsiders the financial and economic crisis of 
2007-2009 and the present debate about the regulation of finance in the 
light of a vision of how finance can better serve the American economy 
and American democracy. The central claim is that regulation as 
conventionally understood cannot adequately redress the problems, and 
seize the opportunities, revealed by the crisis. We should approach 
financial regulation as the first step in a series of institutional 
innovations designed to put finance more effectively at the service of 
the real economy (financial deepening) while broadening economic 
opportunity in the country (financial democratization). I develop and 
defend this thesis by arguing for four subsidiary claims. A first 
subsidiary claim is that a major part of the causal background to the 
crisis was an inconclusive hollowing out of the New Deal regime for the 
governance of finance. That regime failed to be replaced by an 
alternative coherent scheme. Instead, it gave way to a ramshackle 
compromise – powerful, opaque, recalcitrant, and damaging. Such a 
situation – I argue – represents the rule rather than the exception in 
the history of law and institutions. The outcome of the hollowing out in
 the United States was a weakening of the links of finance to the real 
economy, paradoxically accompanied by the hypertrophy of the financial 
sector. A second subsidiary claim is that the New Deal critics and 
reformers of finance, such as Louis Brandeis and William Douglas, were 
right in their intuition that a strong link exists between the legal and
 institutional requirements of financial deepening and of financial 
democratization. A third subsidiary claim is that to make good on this 
intuition in today's circumstances we need a new agenda of reform with 
an explicit and ambitious institutional content. Such an agenda includes
 the transfer of sophisticated financial capabilities to the country's 
remarkable network of local banks as well as a vast expansion and 
popularization of financial services, channeling long-term saving into 
long-term productive investment. A fourth subsidiary claim is that law 
and legal thought provide the chief storehouse of the ideas and methods 
needed to conceive and to implement such innovations. Prevailing styles 
of economic theory, including those underlying the dominant practice of 
“law and economics,” remain largely bereft of institutional imagination.
 This article illustrates how a revised practice of legal and 
institutional analysis can help fill this lacuna. In so doing, this 
piece takes "law and economics" in another direction.</td>

			<h2>An Archeology of Cryptography: Rewriting Plaintext, Encryption, and Ciphertext</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This dissertation is an archeological study of cryptography. 
It questions the validity of thinking about cryptography in familiar, 
instrumentalist terms, and instead reveals the ways that cryptography 
can been understood as writing, media, and computation. In this 
dissertation, I offer a critique of the prevailing views of cryptography
 by tracing a number of long overlooked themes in its history, including
 the development of artificial languages, machine translation, media, 
code, notation, silence, and order. Using an archeological method, I 
detail historical conditions of possibility and the technical a priori 
of cryptography. The conditions of possibility are explored in three 
parts, where I rhetorically rewrite the conventional terms of art, 
namely, plaintext, encryption, and ciphertext. I argue that plaintext 
has historically been understood as kind of inscription or form of 
writing, and has been associated with the development of artificial 
languages, and used to analyze and investigate the natural world. I 
argue that the technical a priori of plaintext, encryption, and 
ciphertext is constitutive of the syntactic and semantic properties 
detailed in Nelson Goodman's theory of notation, as described in his 
Languages of Art. I argue that encryption (and its reverse, decryption) 
are deterministic modes of transcription, which have historically been 
thought of as the medium between plaintext and ciphertext. By developing
 a new understanding of encryption as standing between two agents, I 
characterize the process in terms of media. As media, encryption 
technologies participate in historical desires for commodious and even 
“angelic” transmission, popular until the twentieth century. I identify 
how cryptanalysis, or “code-breaking,” is distinct from cryptography, 
and instead relates to language, being associated with the history of 
machine translation. Finally, I argue that ciphertext is the 
perspectival, ordered result of encryption—similar to computation—and 
resists attempts to be spoken. Since ciphertext resists being spoken, 
its application problematizes the category of language, and has, at 
least once in antiquity, been considered a means of creating silence. 
This dissertation is the first of its kind to offer a historically-rich,
 ontological analysis of cryptography, which therefore opens the topic 
to new fields of scholarship and humanistic forms of inquiry.</td>

						<td>Blockchain technology has emerged as a new paradigm to build 
decentralized systems which do not require a central authority. It is 
most popular for enabling Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies. However, 
blockchain applications span beyond Finance, and recently it has been 
applied to decentralized governance. Blockchain-enabled "Decentralized 
Autonomous Organizations"(DAOs) have emerged as a new form of collective
 governance, in which communities may organize themselves relying on 
decentralized infrastructure. In this article, we introduce the concept 
of DAO and review the main software platforms that offer DAO creation as
 a service, which simplifies the use of DAOs to non-blockchain experts; 
namely: Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus and Colony. These platforms will be 
compared by showing their key features. Finally, we will review the 
available visualisation tools for DAOs, and we will introduce our 
open-source tool to plot DAOs activity, DAO-Analyzer. We will illustrate
 its potential with the case of the DAO Genesis Alpha, which is the main
 DAO of the DAOstack project.</td>

						<td>The paper critically examines the framework for the regulation
 of crypto assets in Malta, with a particular focus on anti-money 
laundering and funding of terrorism. It identifies the risks relating to
 crypto assets, and how these are addressed through Malta's Virtual 
Financial Assets Framework. To this end, the paper argues that the 
Maltese framework goes beyond the EU's fifth Anti-Money Laundering 
Directive. In this connection, the paper also argues that the Maltese 
framework could possibly be a model for a more extensive EU regime in 
this context. Finally, the paper sets forth recommendations towards 
action which may be taken at an EU level in order to address the money 
laundering and terrorism financing threats associated with crypto 
assets.</td>

						<td>In 2019 European Commission announced “The European Green 
Deal” a “a new growth strategy that aims to transform the EU into a fair
 and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and 
competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases
 in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use”. The 
digital sector must also participate in the Green Deal effort. This 
articles analyzes questions of sustainability in the context of crypto 
assets, with particular emphasis on the question of whether Bitcon 
acutally represent a crypto asset, energy consumption, energy drain, the
 proof-of-work consensus protocol, the environmental footprint of crypto
 assets. The article concludes that Bitcoin's current effect on 
environment remains controversial at best.</td>

						<td>This research provides insights for the separation of 
cryptocurrencies from other assets. Using dimensionality reduction 
techniques, we show that most of the variation among cryptocurrencies, 
stocks, exchange rates, commodities, bonds, and real estate indexes can 
be explained by the tail, memory and moment factors of their 
log-returns. By applying various classification methods, 
cryptocurrencies are categorized as a separate asset class, mainly due 
to the tail factor. The main result is the complete separation of 
cryptocurrencies from the other asset types, using the Maximum Variance 
Components Split method. Additionally, we show that cryptocurrencies 
tend to exhibit similar characteristics over time and become more 
distinguished from other asset classes (synchronic evolution).</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007–09, 
political economists have typically identified and interrogated 
speculative logics and credit-debt relations as the markers of 
financialized capitalism. This paper argues that assets, and the 
contingent processes which turn all manner of things into assets (i.e. 
‘assetization'), can also be usefully foregrounded to understand the 
character and movement of financialized capitalism in the contemporary 
conjuncture, particularly in its Anglo-American heartlands. Centred on 
assets and assetization, research is refocused on the constitution of 
political economies of rent and investment, especially as the frontiers 
of financialized capitalism are extended to further incorporate nature 
and society. Research into financialized capitalism is also connected 
more explicitly to wider political debates over intensified 
inequalities, as the production and distribution of assets is key to 
wealth disparities and shapes fundamental stratifications across 
society.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Since the 2008 financial crisis, the number of alternative 
currencies aiming at transforming global financial institutions, such as
 local and complementary currencies (LCC) and cryptocurrencies, has 
exploded. Yet the motivations and workings of such monies are relatively
 unknown. This chapter aims to fill this gap by providing a framework 
that uncovers the ideals pursued by alternative currencies, and the 
effects of those ideals on the production of money. To do so, I present a
 comparative analysis of the valuation infrastructure-the processes 
through which value(s) is produced-of one LCC, Sol Violette, and three 
cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ğ1 "June" and impak Coin. Throughout, I 
elaborate on the social meaning of money and the role played by 
alternative currencies in contemporary capitalism. I show that 1) 
despite targeting the same financial institutions, the utopia pursued by
 alternative currencies varies significantly and 2) this utopia is at 
least as important as the technology (e.g. blockchain) in shaping the 
workings of these monies. Based on these findings, I outline some 
implications for the social studies of financial technologies, their 
effects on our societies and their regulation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article discusses the cultural conceptions of trust 
underpinning the experimentation of blockchain startup applications 
beyond the financial sector. Based on qualitative research undertaken in
 the context of the so-called “Blockchain 2.0” scene, we show how a 
peculiar conception of trust, which blends the libertarian views of 
blockchain inventors with the neoliberal culture of competition and 
meritocracy that is typical of the startup world, underpins these 
implementations. As a result, we argue that “Blockchain 2.0” 
entrepreneurs ultimately fail to recognize the eminently social nature 
of the trust-building process. They emerge from our observation as 
unable to comprehend the extent to which the implementation of 
blockchain in a societal (i.e., not purely financial) context cannot do 
away with considerations about what kind of “social” the technology 
intervenes within, and find difficult to effectively conceive of how 
this technology embeds in existing social relations and power 
structures.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>As cash has suddenly gone missing from Swedish life, a growing
 range of citizens and institutions have sounded the alarm that cash 
enabled a space of egalitarian access now under threat. But because 
commercial bank currency is gradually displacing public central bank 
currency, cashlessness in Sweden is not only threatening its egalitarian
 ethos but also the Swedish Central Bank's capacity to provide a 
guaranteed state payment mechanism. The consequences of Sweden's battles
 over cash-issuance may presage the future of our global banking system 
in a digital age, while also illuminating what is here called currency's
 “tethering mechanism.” Because bank-issued currencies represent chains 
of credit/debt, exchanging and storing different currencies can tether 
and de-tether their users to different institutions, thereby offering 
anthropologists the possibility of mapping the waxing and waning of 
various dominant social institutions.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In recent years, “blockchain” has emerged as an industry 
buzzword, a technology that can solve pressing problems in economic 
inclusion, democracy, humanitarian aid, sustainability, and supply chain
 management among other things. Whether effective or not, this 
little-understood technology is championed as a way to change 
socio-economic power structures and democratize and decentralize 
established institutions like the financial system and government. 
However, these claims are often unsupported. The hype generated in the 
news and popular discourse about this technology often obscures 
questions of whether power relations are actually changing and how. 
Understanding the visible media frames as a proxy for the power contests
 that went into shaping discourse, this paper critically examines US 
news media coverage of blockchain between 2013 - 2018. It examines the 
news frames used to talk about blockchain, the sponsors of these frames,
 and how these factors have changed over the five-year period. The paper
 finds that blockchain-related news coverage is framed in six general 
ways: Disruptive, Harnessing, Skepticism, Community, Understanding, 
Menace. These frames, especially the disruptive and harnessing frames 
are mainly sponsored by big banks (like J.P. Morgan), big technology 
(like IBM and Microsoft), and Silicon Valley investors. Using this data,
 the paper argues that the narrative of blockchain as a 
democratizing/decentralizing technology is mainly pushed by these 
established institutions and that it is a smokescreen to prevent a 
critical examination of the use of the technology.</td>

						<td>Market-shaping research assumes that firms are the primary

explaining the roles, resources and actions of actors other than firms 
shaping markets remain limited. We address this gap in knowledge by 
drawing on insights from an in-depth ethnography of market-shaping in 
the context of cryptocurrency communities. Our theoretical and empirical
 contributions consist of a typology that highlights four distinct roles
 performed by individuals shaping cryptocurrency markets. We furthermore
 identify six micro-level market actions, and delineate a novel 
theoretical model and propositions outlining the pathways with which 
these actions impact market size, market offerings, as well as market 
functioning. This study thereby establishes an important avenue for 
future research, and offers managerial guidelines enabling practitioners
 attempting to benefit from cryptocurrencies.</td>

digital relationships. Secondly, I stress their structural constraints 
and the issues of regulability fully decentralized blockchains pose. The
 elements underlined highlight the reasons why the financial and banking

						<td>This article sheds new light on the development of 
complementary currencies. Based on a comprehensive survey of the 
literature, the study questions conventional interpretations of these 
social innovations. The article challenges the view that money is the 
only feature that complementary currencies have in common. The author 
argues that in addition to the ways in which connectivity takes place, a
 characteristic feature of these systems is that they operate within 
boundaries. Territoriality, limits to convertibility and other features 
distinguish them from other unofficial currencies such as Bitcoin. Short
 case studies illustrate that these boundaries are interdependent. This 
theoretical framework offers a tool for the analysis of complementary 
currencies and a perspective on the creation of new types of such 
systems.</td>

			<h2>Bitcoin and its spheres of consumption: Transactional orders of consuming money in the Czech and Slovak Bitcoin community</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With the recent proliferation of modes of payment, 
anthropology must increasingly pay closer attention to innovative 
designs and uses of money in Western societies. Money has started to be 
perceived as a consumable service with multiple providers from which to 
choose. In such an environment, the question of how people consume 
money—instead of how they consume with money—grows in importance. This 
article is based on ethnographic research of Bitcoin communities in 
Prague and Bratislava. It examines how users variously consume Bitcoin 
and what consequences these diverse ways of consumption can have for the
 Bitcoin economy. The article identifies two discrete spheres of 
consumption that closely correlate with “transactional orders” or 
spheres of exchange as described in classical works of economic 
anthropology, for example, by Parry and Bloch. One of the spheres is 
concerned with the reproduction of social order, while the other 
considers the personal gain of individual consumers. The article also 
examines the tension between these two spheres and how it is 
dialectically resolved through strategies of conversion. In the final 
discussion, the case of Bitcoin is compared with other anthropological 
accounts of spheres of exchange, with special attention oriented to 
their dissimilarities.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This conference invites us to explore new organisational forms
 and practices that might be alternatives to “neoliberal market 
managerialism” and “financial capitalism”. Our starting point is that 
the latter two phenomena cannot be separated off analytically from 
powerful actors — such as the state — that have co-emerged with and 
played a key role in the evolutionary process through which capitalism 
has come to be (Graeber 2011). Specifically, this paper takes its move 
from Hobbes's (1651/2005) idea of the Leviathan, which has provided a 
foundational intellectual basis for the nation-state form, which is 
today ubiquitous, and on which both neoliberalism and financial 
capitalism are reliant. Hobbes rooted his construct in a pessimistic 
view of humankind that is naturally inclined towards the ‘war of all 
against all'. He argued that people must recognize that such a ‘state of
 nature' is destructive, and must accept, on the basis of utilitarian 
reasoning, the necessity of a social contract to constitute a supreme 
actor whose power is absolute and enforced by a monopoly on violence. 
Hence, the Leviathan and the body politic are constituted at once and 
are irreversible. No exit is allowed; no ethical, moral or religious 
limit can be posed in front of this power. The Leviathan is total 
because there is no room for any other rationality, and finite because 
all people are tied to the social contract. Hobbes's idea of the 
Leviathan has proved to be enduring and alluring, and provides a primary
 focus for this paper. What is especially interesting for us is that 
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have emerged from a similar ‘thought 
experiment' beginning with a ‘state of nature' not unlike Hobbes's 
depiction. Here, the seminal contribution is by the mysterious 
individual or individuals known as Satoshi Nakamoto who, in 2008, 
published a paper that set out the basis for the ‘blockchain technology'
 on which cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and other services, are 
based (Nakamoto 2008). Not unlike Hobbes's ‘state of nature', Nakamoto 
begins with an imaginary world populated by trustless individuals. The 
problem he addresses is how to enable trustworthy transactions on the 
internet without recourse to a ‘trusted third party', such as a 
state-regulated (and state-supported) bank. Indeed, in line with 
libertarian ideology, one of Nakamoto's key objectives was to preclude 
the possibility of any single and all-encompassing ruling authority 
emerging. His elegant solution is Bitcoin, a purely digital 
cryptocurrency that is not administered by any constituted organization 
and is not circumscribed within any consistent jurisdiction. The 
‘blockchain', on which Bitcoin is based, is a public ledger of 
transactions maintained by a dispersed and open-ended number of ‘miners'
 who provide computing power to maintain and guarantee the integrity of 
the ledger. While the Bitcoin economy is tiny compared to official 
currencies — but remarkable compared to alternative and local currencies
 — it plants the seeds of a currency (intended as a mode of regulating 
transactions) that could threaten many of the quasi-monopoly powers that
 the state currently exercises through the central bank, viz: surveying 
and collecting data on citizens and corporations, setting credit rates 
and monetary policy, deciding on and implementing exchange rate 
policies, assuring the robustness of the payment infrastructure, 
protecting the interests of consumers, controlling money-laundering, and
 regulating/supporting existing financial service providers (Murphy 
2014). Nakamoto's attempt to create a money system without a central 
authority is best seen at the intersection of diachronic and synchronic 
issues. Historically, the blockchain is one of a long string of 
information technologies that, since the 1960s, have avoided 
centralization, partly as a defence against possible Soviet nuclear 
attack, and partly in sympathy with the Western open culture of the 
1960s and 1970s. In relation to contemporary phenomena, Bitcoin 
entangles with the state's power and jurisdiction, which is 
simultaenously being challenged by the shadow economy, by individuals 
and corporations choosing where they wish to pay tax, by the free flow 
of information within trans-national information infrastructures, and by
 global internet services and commerce. While Hobbes and Nakamoto start 
from similar positions, they end up in quite different destinations, 
and, since theory can be performative (Austin 1970), this means that 
very different worlds come to be. Analytically, each provides a lens 
through which one can examine the other, in theory and in practice. 
Together, the lenses provide a framing device for reimagining key 
concepts and practices that underpin the contemporary nation-state and, 
by extension, financial capitalism. The full paper will report on this 
comparative analysis. The Bitcoin phenomenon raises interesting 
methodological and theoretical points that we will also explore in the 
paper. Methodologically, the actor-network injunction to ‘follow the 
actors' — i.e. focus on performance — is practically impossible due to 
the sheer scale, technical intricacies, global dispersion and 
far-fetched effects of currency-related phenomena. Focusing on visible 
performance is also misleading theoretically because it fails to 
distinguish between what does not happen, those “influences which 
operate behind the back of agents, and which therefore cannot be found 
in micro-situations” (Knorr-Cetina 1981: 28), and what is purposefully 
avoided (Law and Singleton 2005). Indeed, Bitcoin is a manifestation of a
 totem of digital cultures: there is always an elsewhere, beyond the 
control of organizations. Creating an elsewhere free from Leviathan's 
constraints (which resonates with Foucault's notion of heterotopia) 
disrupts the body politic by exceeding or overflowing its framings 
(Callon 1998). The peculiarity of Bitcoin is not in any frontal clash 
with authority but rather in its strategy of avoidance, which we might 
interpret as a form of différance or the playing of an alternative game.
 What Bitcoin also illustrates is that the link between the micro and 
the macro is neither based on an immutable social contract nor 
maintained by an unbounded power. Rather, scalable and publicly 
accessible computing resources coordinate trustless macro actions 
without necessarily constituting actors and identities (Czarniawska 
2008/2014). The paper will further examine the paradox where the 
supplement of the age of visibility is action without actors and the 
emergence of new boundaries between frontstage and backstage, public and
 secret.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Bitcoin represents the first real-world implementation of a 
“decentralized autonomous organization” (DAO) and offers a new paradigm 
for organization design. Imagine working for a global business 
organization whose routine tasks are powered by a software protocol 
instead of being governed by managers and employees. Task assignments 
and rewards are randomized by the algorithm. Information is not 
channeled through a hierarchy but recorded transparently and securely on
 an immutable public ledger called “blockchain.” Further, the 
organization decides on design and strategy changes through a democratic
 voting process involving a previously unseen class of stakeholders 
called “miners.” Agreements need to be reached at the organizational 
level for any proposed protocol changes to be approved and activated. 
How do DAOs solve the universal problem of organizing with such novel 
solutions? What are the implications? We use Bitcoin as an example to 
shed light on how a DAO works in the cryptocurrency industry, where it 
provides a peer-to-peer, decentralized, and disintermediated payment 
system that can compete against traditional financial institutions. We 
also invited commentaries from renowned organization scholars to share 
their views on this intriguing phenomenon.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged
 as an alternative monetary system that could circumvent political and 
financial authorities. A practice in libertarian prefigurative politics,
 Bitcoin demonstrates the capacity for online subgroups to creatively 
appropriate internet-based technologies to enact alternative futures. 
Andrew Feenberg's critical theory of technology clarifies this capacity 
and outlines the significance of agency in technical action. As 
technology mediates many social relations, it has a significant role in 
the reproduction of social power. Technological agency is therefore a 
crucial site of resistance in which users can form alternative, 
democratic rationalizations of technology. Yet are such instances of 
agency intrinsically democratic? In analysing this aspect of Feenberg's 
theory, this article argues that Bitcoin represents a 'popular 
rationalization' of technology - a creative appropriation of technology 
that empowers some groups while lacking the ethical justification 
necessary to be considered democratic.</td>

						<td>Electricity constitutes the main input factor for miners of 
proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, so they gravitate towards 
countries with cheap energy. We analyze risks associated with this 
geographical centralization of mining by exploiting an exogenous shock 
to electricity supply in a relatively small region with heavy Bitcoin 
mining activity. We first document a drop of about 25% in the total 
computing power of the Bitcoin network during a blackout that lasts 
several days. Compared to a control group consisting of a proof-of-stake
 cryptocurrency, we find evidence of blockchain congestion as fees 
increase substantially while the number and value of transactions 
decrease. We also document an impact on exchange trading activity. 
Trading volume and especially exchange rate volatility increase while 
liquidity deteriorates during the blackout, even though returns are 
mostly unaffected. Additionally, market integration drops as price 
differences between exchanges increase considerably.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Bitcoin is the oldest and most widely established 
cryptocurrency network with the highest market capitalization among all 
cryptocurrencies. Although bitcoin (with lowercase b) is increasingly 
viewed as a digital asset belonging to a new asset class, the Bitcoin 
network (with uppercase B) is a decentralized financial market 
infrastructure (dFMI) that clears and settles transactions in its native
 asset without relying on the conventional financial market 
infrastructures (FMIs). To be a reliable asset class as well as a dFMI, 
however, Bitcoin needs to have robust governance arrangements; whether 
such arrangements are built into the protocol (i.e., on-chain governance
 mechanisms) or relegated to the participants in the Bitcoin network 
(i.e., off-chain governance mechanisms), or are composed of a 
combination of both mechanisms (i.e., hybrid form of governance). This 
paper studies Bitcoin governance with a focus on its alleged 
shortcomings. In so doing, after defining Bitcoin governance and its 
objectives, the paper puts forward an idiosyncratic governance model 
whose main objective is to preserve and maximize the main value 
proposition of Bitcoin, i.e., its censorship-resistant property, which 
allows participants to transact in an environment with minimum social 
trust. Therefore, Bitcoin governance, including the processes through 
which Bitcoin governance crises have been resolved and the standards 
against which the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) are examined, 
should be analyzed in light of the prevailing narrative of Bitcoin as a 
censorship-resistant store of value and payment infrastructure. Within 
such a special governance model, this paper seeks to identify the 
potential shortcomings in Bitcoin governance by reference to the major 
governance crises that posed serious threats to Bitcoin in the last 
decade. It concludes that the existing governance arrangements in the 
Bitcoin network have been largely successful in dealing with Bitcoin's 
major crises that would have otherwise become existential threats to the
 Bitcoin network.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>After its introduction in 2008, increasing Bitcoin prices and a
 booming number of other cryptocurrencies lead to a growing discussion 
of how much energy is consumed during the production of these 
currencies. Being the most expensive and the most popular 
cryptocurrency, both the business world and the research community have 
started to question the energy intensity of Bitcoin mining. This paper 
only focuses on computational power demand during the proof-of-work 
process rather than estimating the whole energy intensity of mining. We 
make use of 160GB of Bitcoin blockchain data to estimate the energy 
consumption and power demand of Bitcoin mining. We considered the 
performance of 269 different hardware models (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and ASIC).
 For estimations, we defined two metrics, namely; minimum consumption 
and maximum consumption. The targeted time span for the analysis was 
from 3 January 2009 to 5 June 2018. We show that the historical peak of 
power consumption of Bitcoin mining took place during the bi-weekly 
period commencing on 18 December 2017 with a demand of between 1.3 and 
14.8 GW. This maximum demand figure was between the installed capacities
 of Finland (∼16 GW) and Denmark (∼14 GW). We also show that, during 
June 2018, energy consumption of Bitcoin mining from difficulty 
recalculation was between 15.47 and 50.24 TWh per year.</td>

but rather display a "balance" and allow them to transact with others. 
However if Alice sends Bob a bitcoin, and they’re both customers of the

 on the blockchain. This is an e-money service, according to European

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper aims to shed light on the 2017 Bitcoin bubble. 
Firstly, by applying the dynamic time warping algorithm, we identify 
among several financial instruments a subsample of five assets with 
similar characteristics to the cryptocurrency bubble. Interestingly, 
among the fluctuations characterizing these assets, the algorithm shows a
 close affinity between the Bitcoin bubble and the 2000 NASDAQ Dotcom 
one. Once the subsample is identified, we study the (de)synchronization 
among these assets via the wavelet coherence approach. Although Bitcoin 
is poorly correlated with the other indices, given its scarce connection
 with the real economy, we observe switching phenomena among these 
instruments. A more careful study on these portfolio reallocations, 
conducted via an event study analysis, reveals that traders seem to 
redirect capital from stock markets and gold to Bitcoin in case of 
positive events of the cryptocurrency.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The carbon footprint of Bitcoin has drawn wide attention, but 
Bitcoin's long-term impact on the climate remains uncertain. Here we 
present a framework to overcome uncertainties in previous estimates and 
project Bitcoin's electricity consumption and carbon footprint in the 
long term. If we assume Bitcoin's market capitalization grows in line 
with the one of gold, we find that the annual electricity consumption of
 Bitcoin may increase from 60 to 400 TWh between 2020 and 2100. The 
future carbon footprint of Bitcoin strongly depends on the 
decarbonization pathway of the electricity sector. If the electricity 
sector achieves carbon neutrality by 2050, Bitcoin's carbon footprint 
has peaked already. However, in the business-as-usual scenario, 
emissions sum up to 2 gigatons until 2100, an amount comparable to 7% of
 global emissions in 2019. The Bitcoin price spike at the end of 2020 
shows, however, that progressive development of market capitalization 
could yield an electricity consumption of more than 100 TWh already in 
2021, and lead to cumulative emissions of over 5 gigatons by 2100. 
Therefore, we also discuss policy instruments to reduce Bitcoin's future
 carbon footprint.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Bitcoin's increasing energy consumption has triggered a 
passionate debate about the sustainability of the digital currency. And 
yet, most studies have thus far ignored that Bitcoin miners cycle 
through a growing amount of short-lived hardware that could exacerbate 
the growth in global electronic waste. E-waste represents a growing 
threat to our environment, from toxic chemicals and heavy metals 
leaching into soils, to air and water pollutions caused by improper 
recycling. Here we present a methodology to estimate Bitcoin's e-waste 
and find that it adds up to 30.7 metric kilotons annually, per May 2021.
 This number is comparable to the amount of small IT and 
telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the 
Netherlands. At peak Bitcoin price levels seen early in 2021, the annual
 amount of e-waste may grow beyond 64.4 metric kilotons in the midterm, 
which highlights the dynamic trend if the Bitcoin price rises further. 
Moreover, the demand for mining hardware already today disrupts the 
global semiconductor supply chain. The strategies we present may help to
 mitigate Bitcoin's growing e-waste problem.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>[Figure presented] The electricity that is expended in the 
process of mining Bitcoin has become a topic of heavy debate over the 
past few years. It is a process that makes Bitcoin extremely 
energy-hungry by design, as the currency requires a huge amount of hash 
calculations for its ultimate goal of processing financial transactions 
without intermediaries (peer-to-peer). The primary fuel for each of 
these calculations is electricity. The Bitcoin network can be estimated 
to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and 
potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with 
countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts). 
Economic models tell us that Bitcoin's electricity consumption will 
gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production 
estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.</td>

						<td>Blockchain technology provides an immutable ledger for secure 
value transactions in a network. This base layer technology has the 
potential to boost the efficiency of various processes in the energy 
sector. In this article, the intersection of blockchain and energy is 
analyzed based on the underlying references of 166 publications via 
co-citation analysis. Using exploratory factor analysis, six distinct 
research streams are identified: I. energy market innovation and 
transformation (through blockchain technology), II. blockchain for data 
sharing and security, III. energy management in smart grids and scalable
 systems, IV. information transmission across networks and its 
applications, V. peer-to-peer energy microgrids, and VI. potential of 
blockchain technology. For each of these streams, the highest-impact 
articles are reviewed. In addition, social network analysis allows to 
reveal the relationships and dependencies between the streams. The 
results indicate a high degree of homogeneity in this field of research,
 as the six streams explain more than 71% of variance. The degree to 
which the streams are centered on blockchain technology varies. While 
the two most established discourses and the least established one focus 
at least in part on blockchain, the other three streams prioritize 
energy issues. It is postulated that specific research fields on this 
topic are only beginning to emerge, implications are discussed and areas
 for future research are derived.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In a recent survey of academic research, Fintech related 
topics, broadly classified as crypto-currency studies, were by far the 
most researched topics in the social sciences. However, we have observed
 that, perhaps surprisingly, even though crypto-currencies rely on a 
distributed accounting ledger technology, relatively few of those 
studies were conducted by accounting academics. While some of the 
features of a system like Bitcoin do not necessarily rely on a 
traditional accounting knowledge, this knowledge is key in designing 
effective real-world distributed systems. Building on a foundational 
framework developed by Risius and Spohrer (2017), we provide support for
 their hypothesis that to date, research in this area has been 
predominantly of a somewhat narrow focus (i.e., based upon exploiting 
existing programming solutions without adequately considering the 
fundamental needs of users). This is particularly reflected by the 
abundance of Bitcoin-like crypto-currency code-bases with little or no 
place for business applications. We suggest that this may severely limit
 an appreciation of the relevance and applicability of decentralized 
systems, and how they may support value creation and improved 
governance. We provide supporting arguments for this statement by 
considering four applied classes of problems where a 
blockchain/distributed ledger can add value without requiring a 
crypto-currency to be an integral part of the functioning system. We 
note that each class of problem has been viewed previously as part of 
accounting issues within the legacy centralized ledger systems paradigm.
 We show how accounting knowledge is still relevant in the shift from 
centralized to decentralized ledger systems. We advance the debate on 
the development of (crypto-currency free) value-creating distributed 
ledger systems by showing that applying accounting knowledge in this 
area has potentially a much wider impact than that currently being 
applied in areas limited to auditing and operations management. We 
develop a typology for general distributed ledger design which assists 
potential users to understand the wide range of choices when developing 
such systems.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Renewable energy technologies play a crucial role in reducing 
the energy consumption by exploiting natural energy resources. With the 
increase in the trend towards the use of renewable energy resources 
energy distribution networks have become more complex. As such, it is 
envisioned that efficient distribution of the generated energy, illegal 
energy use, unfair pricing, and individual energy producers' entry into 
the market will be the key issues that need be tackled in near future. 
In this study, we discuss in order to eliminate the problems experienced
 in the energy grid management process, the blockchain concept, and its 
integration with renewable energy systems. First, we develop a novel 
integration process of blockchain with the renewable energy systems 
under the circular economy perspective in order to ensure the 
sustainability of energy grid management systems, followed by 
discussions on the advantages of the proposed integration process for 
energy policy makers. Second, the challenges of blockchain faced during 
the integration to a circular economy are presented. In order to 
prioritize the challenges encountered in the integration process, a 
numerical analysis is conducted using the Pythagorean Fuzzy Analytical 
Hierarchy Process method based on expert opinions, and corresponding 
managerial implications are included.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article offers a normative analysis of key blockchain 
technology concepts from the perspective of copyright law. Some features
 of blockchain technologies - scarcity, trust, transparency, 
decentralized public records and smart contracts - seem to make this 
technology compatible with the fundamentals of copyright. Authors can 
publish works on blockchain creating a quasi-immutable record of initial
 ownership, and encode 'smart' contracts to license the use of works. 
Remuneration may happen on online distribution platforms where the smart
 contracts reside. In theory, such an automated setup allows for the 
private ordering of copyright. Blockchain technology, like Digital 
Rights Management 20 years ago, is thus presented as an opportunity to 
reduce market friction, and increase both licensing efficiency and the 
autonomy of creators. Yet, some of the old problems remain. The article 
examines the differences between new, smartcontract-based private 
ordering regime and the fundamental components of copyright law, such as
 exceptions and limitations, the doctrine of exhaustion, restrictions on
 formalities, the public domain and fair remuneration.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertes (CNIL), has 
published “Blockchain: Premiers elements d'analyse de la CNIL”, a 
document on blockchain and the European Union General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR). This document was released by the French Data 
Protection Authority (DPA) as a working policy paper and offers an 
overview of its initial reflection on the Blockchain technology and its 
compliance with the GDPR. The CNIL notes the GDPR has been created to 
regulate data use, rather than any particular form of technology. As 
such, and without surprise to anyone familiar with privacy law, the CNIL
 states the GDPR applies to the use of blockchain in any instance where 
personal data is handled. However, this working paper is a very raw 
analysis. In our opinion, the document raises more questions than it 
answers – and highlights some legal uncertainty with respect to the 
qualifications of different actors on a blockchain under the GDPR 
taxonomy. In several areas, the CNIL highlights that more reflection is 
needed on its end, and that this reflection needs to be undertaken at 
the European level.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper discusses the emergence of blockchain technology in
 the energy sector in the light of ongoing energy market transformation.
 The study builds on literature research and expert interviews, and 
provides insights into the future energy landscape in the context of the
 blockchain advent. While the interviewees acknowledge the great, though
 disruptive, potential of blockchain technology for the primary 
activities in the electricity sector, there is agreement that inflexible
 regulatory frameworks impose the biggest challenge. The widest impact 
which blockchain technology will have in the short-term will be in 
electric vehicle integration, while in the long-term blockchain will 
enable peer-to-peer microgrids. The role that the blockchain will play, 
though, relies mainly on the business model innovation in energy. While a
 growing body of literature discusses specific blockchain applications 
and solutions in an advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a
 holistic picture of the blockchain applicability in the energy sector 
and thematises this very powerful and versatile technology against the 
background of two emerging economies: South Africa and Russia.</td>

						<td>We are living in a world where the very systems upon which 
trust is based are being challenged by new and exciting paradigm shifts.
 Centralization whether in the form of governments, financial 
institutions, enterprises and organizations is simply being challenged 
because of the lack of trust associated with data governance often 
experienced in the form of data breaches or simply a monetization of our
 data without our permission and/or incentives to participate in this 
emerging decentralization of structures. We see this trust deficit 
challenging the very institutions we have depended on including but not 
limited to financial institutions, private enterprises or government 
bodies. A new "social contract" is required as we continuously evolve 
into more decentralized and self-governing (or semi self-governing) 
entities. We will see more development in digital sovereignty with the 
caveat that a governance model will need to be defined. This position 
paper will present evidence that supports the premise that blockchain 
and individual tokenization could provide a new social contract.</td>

						<td>Our research consolidates the actual environment of blockchain
 applications that contribute in a certain way to climate protection. In
 view of the growing interest in climate change and the need to act on a
 global scale, knowledge about these applications enables investors, 
politicians, and citizens to drive this development forward through 
diverse support opportunities. This article provides an extensive 
overview of existing mitigation and adaptation measures based on 
blockchain technology. We collect data on 85 such applications and 
describe the empirical distributions of different attributes of these 
applications. In a logit regression, we analyze which 
application-specific and blockchain-specific characteristics determine 
the success of an application in the sense of an advanced operational 
status. We find evidence that applications of the type “energy trading” 
exhibit reduced chances of success, while green blockchain-based 
applications implementing a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism are more 
likely to become operational. Moreover, pursuing an initial coin 
offering has no significant effect on the success of an application. Our
 work provides the basis for a better understanding of the success 
factors of this new technology.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain technology was created as a response to the trust 
crisis that swept the world in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. 
Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems were presented as a 
“trustless” alternative to existing financial institutions and even 
governments. Yet, while the trustless nature of blockchain technology 
has been heavily questioned, little research has been done as to what 
blockchain technologies actually bring to the table in place of trust. 
This article draws from the extensive academic discussion on the 
concepts of “trust” and “confidence” to argue that blockchain technology
 is not a ‘trustless technology' but rather a ‘confidence machine'. 
First, the article provides a review of the multifaceted 
conceptualisations of trust and confidence, and the relationship between
 these two concepts. Second, the claim is made that blockchain 
technology relies on cryptographic rules, mathematics, and 
game-theoretical incentives in order to increase confidence in the 
operations of a computational system. Yet, such an increase in 
confidence ultimately relies on the proper operation and governance of 
the underlying blockchain-based network, which requires trusting a 
variety of actors. Third, the article turns to legal, constitutional and
 polycentric governance theory to explore the governance challenges of 
blockchain-based systems, in light of the tension between procedural 
confidence and trust.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Today, digitalisation is penetrating every corner of our 
mundane life, thus affecting our being in manifold ways. In spite of 
this, digital technologies provide us with paths towards advancing 
humanity. One way to model the possibilities of the new technologies in a
 sustainable way is to frame them in light of Gilbert Simondon's 
philosophy and especially his understanding of ‘transindividuality', 
which is the foundation for a robust, evolving collective. The 
transindividual relation, mediated by technical objects, is the 
possibility of a concurrent problem-solving at the collective and 
individual level. One of these new technologies, blockchain, a 
decentralised peer-to-peer database, practically demonstrates a complex 
system that can cultivate this transindividuality. Although not without 
its flaws, blockchain nonetheless presents a serious innovation for 
collective being.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain technology is often discussed and theorized in 
relation to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Its quality as a 
technology that produces advanced encryption keys between objects, 
however, also makes it interesting to those who seek to connect physical
 objects to digital elements. The reason for this is that the link 
between objects needs to be ‘secure' from undesired external 
interference. In relation to such interests, blockchain has been 
identified as a highly attractive technology to support the general 
digitalization of society towards the Internet of Things, smart cities 
etc. In extension, the implementation of blockchain technology implies 
that it may work as a tool that has the capacity to direct which objects
 may/may not interact with each other. The ‘ledger of everything' that 
blockchain may possibly produce as regards the ‘Internet of Everything' 
is even suggested to make humans and other intermediary technologies 
redundant. In this essay, I argue that in order to sustain legal 
critique when the world moves into the next era of digitalization, we 
need to understand - and question - how technological control operates 
through e.g. blockchain technology by locking physical and digital 
elements to each other.</td>

						<td>Blockchain technology can reduce transaction costs, generate 
distributed trust, and empower decentralized platforms, potentially 
becoming a new foundation for decentralized business models. In the 
financial industry, blockchain technology allows for the rise of 
decentralized financial services, which tend to be more decentralized, 
innovative, interoperable, borderless, and transparent. Empowered by 
blockchain technology, decentralized financial services have the 
potential to broaden financial inclusion, facilitate open access, 
encourage permissionless innovation, and create new opportunities for 
entrepreneurs and innovators. In this article, we assess the benefits of
 decentralized finance, identify existing business models, and evaluate 
potential challenges and limits. As a new area of financial technology, 
decentralized finance may reshape the structure of modern finance and 
create a new landscape for entrepreneurship and innovation, showcasing 
the promises and challenges of decentralized business models.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The ongoing, in-depth transformation of the electricity sector
 towards increased use of alternative, renewable energy sources extends 
beyond a simple decentralisation drive in the electricity market. The 
transformation process is characterised by the interplay of old and new 
technologies from the energy sector as well as structural coupling with 
other sectors, such as the information and communications technology 
(ICT), enabling the technology transfer as well as market entry by 
information technology (IT) actors. Blockchain-based technologies have 
the potential to play a key role in this transition by offering 
decentralised interfaces and systems as well as an alternative approach 
to the current organisation form of the energy market. This paper 
discusses the applicability and prospects for blockchain-based 
technologies in the energy sector, which are described using the term 
“blockchain energy”. For the purposes of this study, blockchain energy 
encompasses all socio-technical and organisational configurations in the
 energy sector based on the utilisation of the blockchain principle for 
energy trading, information storage, and/or increased transparency of 
energy flows and energy services. In the following chapters, the authors
 present and discuss the current transformation in the electricity 
market, followed by a review of the different utilisation possibilities 
for blockchain technologies in the energy sector and a discussion of the
 barriers and potential for blockchain energy using a transition studies
 perspective. Finally, the opportunities and risks of blockchain energy 
are discussed.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The decentralisation of energy supply and demand can 
contribute decisively to protecting the environment and climate of the 
planet by consuming electricity in the proximity of the generation 
source and avoiding losses in transmission and distribution. Supporting 
energy transactions with emerging intelligent technologies can advance 
the development of energy communities and accelerate the integration of 
renewable sources. Distributed energy solutions play an essential role 
as they are explicitly designed to produce, store and deliver green 
energy. Profiting with these benefits is essential, especially in the 
context of the current debate on stopping climate change. Several 
technologies such as waste heat recovery with intelligent algorithms can
 improve the energy distribution and provide significant resource 
savings. On the other hand, the usage of Blockchain technology in energy
 markets promises to incentivise the use of renewables and provide a 
reliable framework to monitor real-time information of energy production
 and consumption. Blockchain can also enable trading between independent
 agents and lead to the formation of more secured energy communities. In
 this paper, we demonstrate how Blockchain can be utilised to support 
the formation and use of energy communities. We propose a 
Blockchain-based energy framework as a mean to support energy exchanges 
in a community of prosumers. We demonstrate how smart contracts can 
manage energy transactions and enable a more secured trading environment
 between consumers and producers. We utilise data and models from a real
 fish processing industrial site in Milford Haven Port, South Wales, 
based on which we validate our research hypothesis.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The concept of smart grid has been introduced as a new vision 
of the conventional power grid to figure out an efficient way of 
integrating green and renewable energy technologies. In this way, 
Internet-connected smart grid, also called energy Internet, is also 
emerging as an innovative approach to ensure the energy from anywhere at
 any time. The ultimate goal of these developments is to build a 
sustainable society. However, integrating and coordinating a large 
number of growing connections can be a challenging issue for the 
traditional centralized grid system. Consequently, the smart grid is 
undergoing a transformation to the decentralized topology from its 
centralized form. On the other hand, blockchain has some excellent 
features which make it a promising application for the smart grid 
paradigm. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey on 
the application of blockchain in smart grid. As such, we identify the 
significant security challenges of smart grid scenarios that can be 
addressed by blockchain. Then, we present a number of blockchain-based 
recent research works presented in different literature addressing 
security issues in the area of smart grid. We also summarize several 
related practical projects, trials, and products that have emerged 
recently. Finally, we discuss essential research challenges and future 
directions of applying blockchain to smart grid security issues.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>After smart grid, Internet of Energy (IoE) has emerged as a 
popular technology in the energy sector by integrating different forms 
of energy. IoE uses Internet to collect, organize, optimize and manage 
the networks energy information from different edge devices in order to 
develop a distributed smart energy infrastructure. Sensors and 
communication technologies are used to collect data and to predict 
demand and supply by consumers and suppliers respectively. However, with
 the development of renewable energy resources, Electric Vehicles (EVs),
 smart grid and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, the existing energy 
sector started shifting towards distributed and decentralized solutions.
 Moreover, the security and privacy issues because of centralization is 
another major concern for IoE technology. In this context, Blockchain 
technology with the features of automation, immutability, public ledger 
facility, irreversibility, decentralization, consensus and security has 
been adopted in the literature for solving the prevailing problems of 
centralized IoE architecture. By leveraging smart contracts, blockchain 
technology enables automated data exchange, complex energy transactions,
 demand response management and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading etc. 
Blockchain will play vital role in the evolution of the IoE market as 
distributed renewable resources and smart grid network are being 
deployed and used. We discuss the potential and applications of 
blockchain in the IoE field. This article is build on the literature 
research and it provides insight to the end-user regarding the future 
IoE scenario in the context of blockchain technology. Lastly this 
article discusses the different consensus algorithm for IoE technology.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This essay considers the ideological context of blockchain 
technology. This technology is often celebrated for its potential for 
decentralization, distribution, privacy, and a lack of intermediaries 
and coordinators for transactions and general governance. Because of 
these features, blockchain technology, and, in particular, its most 
famous inauguration - the bitcoin blockchain - is frequently identified 
with libertarianism. In this essay, we argue that the ideological 
context of blockchain technology is much more complicated. In addition 
to unraveling a number of background ideologies and their role in this 
technology, we raise the ontological issue concerning the relationship 
of ideology to technology. These matters have implications for, among 
other things, the approach that should be taken to blockchain's 
governance, as well as how international lawyers may approach this 
foreign-seeming phenomenon that has its proponents from the European 
Central Bank to the United Nations (not, however, forgetting the private
 sector nor the digital underground).</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>A key challenge behind the adoption of blockchain in the 
public sector is understanding the dynamics of blockchain governance. 
Based on a systematic literature review, this article analyzes different
 approaches to blockchain governance across disciplines and develops a 
comprehensive conceptual framework for the study of blockchain 
governance decisions in the public sector. The framework clusters nine 
types of governance decisions (infrastructure architecture, application 
architecture, interoperability, decision-making mechanism, incentive 
mechanism, consensus mechanism, organization of governance, 
accountability of governance, and control of governance) into three 
levels of analysis (micro, meso, and macro-levels). Drawing on public 
management theories and concepts, the article elucidates the 
implications of various governance choices in each level of governance 
and provides a primer for researchers and policy practitioners on the 
design of blockchain-based systems in the public sector.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The recent emergence of blockchains may be considered a 
critical turning point in organizing collaborations. We outline the 
historical background and the fundamental features of blockchains and 
present an analysis with a focus on their role as governance mechanisms.
 Specifically, we argue that blockchains offer a way to enforce 
agreements and achieve cooperation and coordination that is distinct 
from both traditional contractual and relational governance as well as 
from other information technology solutions. We also examine the scope 
of blockchains as efficient governance mechanisms and highlight the 
tacitness of the transaction as a key boundary condition. We then 
discuss how blockchain governance interacts with traditional governance 
mechanisms in both substitutive and complementary ways. We pay 
particular attention to blockchains' social implications as well as 
their inherent challenges and limitations. Our analysis culminates in a 
research agenda that explores how blockchains may change the way to 
organize collaborations, including issues of what different types of 
blockchains may emerge, who is involved and impacted by blockchain 
governance, why actors may want blockchains, when and where blockchains 
can be more (versus less) effective, and how blockchains influence a 
number of important organizational outcomes.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Governance of blockchain technologies has not been 
historically prioritized beyond technological dimensions, and relatively
 little literature exists on the prescriptive governance of blockchain 
platforms. Existing governance frameworks, such as IT governance, may 
not be suitable or easily applied to the novel context of blockchain; 
instead, the authors of this chapter argue it may be more appropriate to
 adopt a grounded approach to the development of governance theory for 
blockchains. Situating their discussion of blockchain governance within 
existing, external power structures—legal, political, economic, 
environmental, and social—the authors outline an internal governance 
framework for the blockchain system itself. Taking an inclusive, 
question-led approach, this internal governance framework aims to ensure
 that areas of risk are identified, and determine how conflict and 
crisis related to blockchain technology—and blockchain-enabled forms of 
organization and interactions—can be handled.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper argues that many so-called digital technologies can
 be construed as notational technologies, explored through the example 
of Monegraph, an art and digital asset management platform built on top 
of the blockchain system originally developed for the cryptocurrency 
bitcoin. As the paper characterizes it, a notational technology is the 
performance of syntactic notation within a field of reference, a 
technologized version of what Nelson Goodman called a “notational 
system.” Notational technologies produce abstracted entities through 
positive and reliable, or constitutive, tests of socially acceptable 
meaning. Accordingly, this account deviates from typical narratives of 
blockchains (usually characterized as Turing or state machines), instead
 demonstrating that blockchain technologies are effective at managing 
digital assets because they produce abstracted identities through the 
performance of notation. Since notational technologies rely on 
configurations of socially acceptable meaning, this paper also provides a
 philosophical account of how blockchain technologies are socially 
embedded.</td>

Blockchain, Bitcoin, smart contracts, the Internet of Things, machine 
translation, image recognition, the Earth Bank of Codes-all are 
understood to be not only business opportunities but also political and 
environmental issues. Seldom mentioned, however, is the extent to which 
these innovations are part of an ecological history that goes back to 
the early 19 th century and before. A strategic understanding their 
dynamics and contradictions requires looking again at long-standing 
pictures of labour, mechanization, commons, and capital accumulation. 
Different ways of thinking about Marx's categories of living and dead 
labour inspired by the work of the later Wittgenstein can help. 1</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article focusses on the social and legal implications 
that blockchain technology brings about, not only due to its ideological
 framework, but also, and especially, due to the concept of law it 
inaugurates. Thus, this article claims, that, by interlocking 
technological and legal structures, blockchain technology initiates a 
profound displacement of legal symbolics and imaginaries. It shows how 
blockchain law, by emancipating itself from three essential dimensions 
of law—language, territory, and the body—implies a profound disruption 
of how we perceive law and its legitimacy. Starting with an overview of 
the technological details of blockchain, the paper then addresses its 
ideological context and traces the underlying ideas, values and 
functions and their relation with—and impact on—the general perception 
of law and legal issues. By critically assessing the claim that 
blockchain will liberate the subject from any heteronymic constraints, 
this paper analyses to what extent this technology has social and legal 
implications that reach far beyond its virtual, purely 
blockchain-related scope of applications—and why this technology should 
matter to us all.</td>

blockchains as a novel institutional building block for voluntary 
economic exchange and distributed governance, with their unique protocol
 features such as automated contract execution, high levels of network 
and process transparency, and uniquely distributed governance. But such 
institutional analysis needs to be complemented by polycentric analysis 
of how blockchains change. We characterize such change as resulting from
 internal sources and external sources. Internal sources include 
constitutional (protocol) design and collective-choice processes for 
updating protocols, which help coordinate network participants and 
users. External sources include competitive pressure from other 
cryptocurrency networks. By studying two leading networks, Bitcoin and 
Ethereum, we illustrate how conceptualizing blockchains as competing and
 constitutional polycentric enterprises clarifies their processes of 
change.</td>

 start from the current distinction between different types of tokens 
and argue that it can create confusion and should be at least partially 
abandoned. We believe that the conceptual difference between a currency 
token and a tradable utility token is just the dimension of the crypto 
environment in which the token is spent. More specifically, ‘utility 
tokens' combine the customer payment mechanism with the utility 
component and, when tradable on a secondary market, the investment one. 
We argue that they blur the traditional distinctions between currencies,
 financial assets and consumption goods. Moreover, we stress the 
increasing importance of online crypto exchanges. Recently some 
exchanges have also taken up the role of trusted intermediaries and 
staked their reputation on token offerings, which are termed initial 
exchange offerings and have gained in popularity. We therefore argue 
that the crypto market increasingly looks like a segment of the capital 
market and behaves as such. Given that tokens have a clear investment 
component, we show that they are tradable securities under the 
Prospectus Regulation. We compare the European securities regulation 
with its US counterpart and focus on prospectus exemptions, highlighting
 the great differences between Europe and the US which make Europe less 
amicable to blockchain startups.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper argues that the practical implementation of 
blockchain technology can be considered an institution of property 
similar to legal institutions. Invoking Penner's theory of property and 
Hegel's system of property rights, and using the example of bitcoin, it 
is possible to demonstrate that blockchain effectively implements all 
necessary and sufficient criteria for property without reliance on legal
 means. Blockchains eliminate the need for a third-party authority to 
enforce exclusion rights, and provide a system of universal access to 
knowledge and discoverability about the property rights of all 
participants and how the system functions. The implications of these 
findings are that traditional property relations in society could be 
replaced by or supplemented with blockchain models, and implemented in 
new domains.</td>

			<h2>Blockchain, Disintermediation and the Future of the Legal Professions</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Will the 2020s herald the death warrant of the legal 
professions? If we listen to blockchain technology's most devout 
advocates, the answer is a resounding yes. Blockchain is often 
proclaimed as the ultimate tool for allowing unrestrained exchanges 
between contracting parties with no preexisting relationships, and thus 
suppressing the need for intermediaries. In other words, blockchain 
could be a “trust machine,” which could open up the possibility of 
conducting transactions in full confidence, without the risk of 
non-performance or misguidance. However, it is utopian idealism to 
assume that blockchain technology could enable pure and total 
disintermediation. All trusted third parties cannot disappear in one 
fell swoop - especially legal professions. This Article problematizes 
blockchain's apparent objective of disintermediation and argues that, in
 reality, blockchain leads to a form of reintermediation. Of course, the
 role of the legal professions in the face of the advance blockchain 
technology is inextricable to the role of the law in blockchain. While 
advocates have detailed the diminishing role of law and regulation in 
the application of blockchain technology, we adopt a comparison of the 
French and the American jurisdiction's to blockchain technology, to 
demonstrate that, in fact, the law cannot be extricated from 
blockchain's advance. This Article explores a new angle on blockchain's 
place in the legal professions and offers new perspectives for lawyers 
to anticipate a future defined by “known unknowns,” and the “unknown 
unknowns” of blockchain technology .</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR), the broader, mainstream emergence of blockchain technology in 
the present moment of, what I call, data dysphoria is no accident. It is
 in part reaction to data dysphoria, and in part exploitation of it, a 
duality underpinned by the tantalising promise of the prosumer ‘taking 
control' of their data and establishing sovereignty over it. Blockchain 
and GDPR alike aim to resolve ‘problem'/'solution' matrices with deep 
roots in a wide variety of global economic, political, social, legal and
 cultural contexts. This article explores the problem of achieving 
resolution based on innovation and technology by offering an account of 
the rise of blockchain and implementation of GDPR within a 
psycho-political framework, one in which fantasies of taking control are
 predominant yet highly contestable actualities in the lives of 
technology users.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Summary Blockchains are aggregated and distributed databases: 
shared, chained, and immutable registries that conflate the production 
of digital tokens with their circulation. At their most basic level, 
they are technologies for keeping account, or records, of some form of 
activity, hence they are part of a long lineage of storing data, from 
clay tablets to bookkeeping. On a technical level, blockchains are 
peer-to-peer (P2P) structures for distributing and storing data. This 
chapter begins with a historical consideration of the emergence of peer 
production, including a reevaluation of the work of Yochai Benkler. It 
shows that peer production was given coherence as a model of production 
by being contrasted with two other modes (hierarchies and markets) and 
through the lens of Benkler's economic liberalism. The chapter 
distinguishes between four moments or aspects of blockchain initiatives 
that configure peers in different ways: peer production, peer 
development, peer governance, and peer exchange.</td>

						<td>This paper examines Bitcoin from a legal and regulatory 
perspective, answering several important questions. We begin by 
explaining what Bitcoin is, and why it matters. We describe problems 
with Bitcoin as a method of implementing a cryptocurrency. This 
introduction to cryptocurrencies allows us eventually to ask the 
inevitable question: Is it legal? What are the regulatory responses to 
the currency? Can it be regulated? We make clear why virtual currencies 
are of interest, how self-regulation has failed, and what useful lessons
 can be learned. Finally, we produce useful and semi-permanent findings 
into the usefulness of virtual currencies in general, blockchains as a 
means of mining currency, and the profundity of Bitcoin as compared with
 the development of block chain technologies. We conclude that though 
Bitcoin may be the equivalent of Second Life a decade later, so 
blockchains may be the equivalent of Web 2.0 social networks, a truly 
transformative social technology.</td>

“blockchain” is just a horribly inefficient append-only file which costs
 a literal fortune to secure without actually providing meaningful

actual currencies for legal real world transactions. Beyond the sheer 
uselessness have emerged a whole host of bad ideas, ranging from the 
“put a bird^H^H^H^H blockchain on it” hype to unregistered (and mostly 
fraudulent) securities with “Initial Coin Offerings” to an invitation

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchains combine digital encryption and time stamping 
technologies to enable digital exchange to occur in manners celebrated 
by proponents as ‘trust-free'. Yet, an increasing range of scholars 
argue that actual applications of the peer-to-peer technology shifts, 
rather than eliminates, trust. In this article, we draw on 
organizational theory to argue that efforts to remove trust reorganize 
the action nets that underpin payment systems in manners that extend 
rather than eliminate longstanding pathologies afflicting financial 
globalization. Our analysis supports and extends the critiques that 
blockchain applications are far from ‘trust-free'. By tracing how 
efforts to reconfigure the socio-technical composition of the humans and
 objects that underpin payment systems, we illustrate how blockchain 
applications shift the location and character of the technical 
vulnerabilities that create market instabilities and concentration, as 
well as elite-led governance.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article presents a survey of broad-based 
stakeholder-ownership models for journalism. The models considered are 
forms of ownership by employees, associations, audiences, and blends of 
these. Some of the examples are so new that they have not been, and 
cannot yet be, comprehensively studied. Yet they bear unique promise for
 addressing the dual challenges of economic sustainability and perceived
 accountability that bedevil news media today. Such promise, however, 
does not guarantee success. While broad-based stakeholder ownership in 
the news business shows capacity for public accountability, as well as 
some promise for business sustainability, it is ill-equipped to compete 
in markets organized to favor investor-owners with far greater capital 
access. Such ownership models, therefore, will likely require additional
 policy support to gain and maintain significant market share.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This commentary explores how blockchain technology is being 
leveraged to improve marine conservation and fisheries supply chain 
management globally. In doing so, the paper considers the technical and 
political challenges of building trust and equity for various 
stakeholders. A blockchain is a smart electronic database, distributed 
to all users, immutably tracking every transaction that has ever taken 
place on the network. The blockchain is very difficult to hack, with no 
single point of authority to make mistakes and collapse the system. 
Automated consensus protocols enable data transmitted on the network to 
be verified and stored immutably, minimising the risk of data corruption
 to near-zero. Blockchain is being increasingly hyped for a range of 
services and industries, including transparent resourcing for marine 
conservation, reducing pollution from plastics, reducing slavery at sea,
 and sustainable fisheries management. Public distrust in some 
conservation operations, as well as in the provenance of seafood, is 
growing. Although some global marine conservation organisations and 
seafood producers have found practical solutions in disruptive 
technologies like blockchain, riding this wave will only prove 
worthwhile if coastal communities and artisanal fishers are on board and
 stand a chance of landing a fair share of the benefits.</td>

						<td>Algorithmic authority is a distinctive and novel mode of 
domination. Akin to other modes described by Weber, it has associated 
organisational forms. This paper identifies and analyses one such form, 
blockocracy, which occurs in the context of blockchain-based 
cryptocurrencies. Taking a processual approach, we describe how 
blockocracy emerged historically out of an anti-bureaucracy ideology, a 
control revolution, a recognition that computer code can regulate 
conduct, and the increasing adoption of algorithms. Taking a shorter 
time-horizon, we identify four layers of algorithmic authority, and, 
focusing on the blockchain layer, we distinguish between off-chain and 
on-chain governance, with the latter having two types of off-chain 
rules. While the fashionable rhetoric is that the blockchain is 
immutable, we see the blockchain as a dynamic quasi-object, defining and
 mutating identities and possibilities. We conclude the paper by 
comparing blockocracy with Weber's depiction of bureaucracy.</td>

						<td>Emergence of the Energy Internet (EI) demands restructuring of
 traditional electricity grids to integrate heterogeneous energy 
sources, distribution network management with grid intelligence and big 
data management. This paradigm shift is considered to be a breakthrough 
in the energy industry towards facilitating autonomous and decentralized
 grid operations while maximizing the utilization of Distributed 
Generation (DG). Blockchain has been identified as a disruptive 
technology enabler for the realization of EI to facilitate reliable, 
self-operated energy delivery. In this paper, we highlight six key 
directions towards utilizing blockchain capabilities to realize the 
envisaged EI. We elaborate the challenges in each direction and 
highlight the role of blockchain in addressing them. Furthermore, we 
summarize the future research directive in achieving fully autonomous 
and decentralized electricity distribution networks, which will be known
 as Energy Internet.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>To non-experts, the traditional Centralized Finance (CeFi) 
ecosystem may seem obscure, because users are typically not aware of the
 underlying rules or agreements of financial assets and products. 
Decentralized Finance (DeFi), however, is making its debut as an 
ecosystem claiming to offer transparency and control, which are 
partially attributable to the underlying integrity-protected blockchain,
 as well as currently higher financial asset yields than CeFi. Yet, the 
boundaries between CeFi and DeFi may not be always so clear cut. In this
 work, we systematically analyze the differences between CeFi and DeFi, 
covering legal, economic, security, privacy and market manipulation. We 
provide a structured methodology to differentiate between a CeFi and a 
DeFi service. Our findings show that certain DeFi assets (such as USDC 
or USDT stablecoins) do not necessarily classify as DeFi assets, and may
 endanger the economic security of intertwined DeFi protocols. We 
conclude this work with the exploration of possible synergies between 
CeFi and DeFi.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The re-emergence of commoning over the last decades is not 
incidental, but rather indicative of a large-scale transition to a more 
“generative” organization of society that is oriented toward the 
planet's global carrying capacity. Digital commons governance frameworks
 are of particular importance for a new global paradigm of cooperation, 
one that can scale the organization of communities around common goals 
and resources to unprecedented levels of size, complexity and 
granularity. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) such as blockchain 
have lately given new impetus to the emergence of a new generation of 
authentic “sharing economy,” protected from capture by thorough 
distribution of power over infrastructure, that spans not only digital 
but also physical production of common value. The exploration of the 
frontiers of DLT-based commoning at the heart of this article considers 
three exemplary cases for this new generation of commons-oriented 
community frameworks: the Commons Stack, Holochain and the Commons 
Engine, and the Economic Space Agency. While these projects differ in 
their scope as well as in their relation to physical common-pool 
resources (CPRs), they all share the task of redefining markets so as to
 be more conducive to the production and sustainment of common value(s).
 After introducing each of them with regards to their specificities and 
commonalities, we analyze their capacity to foster commons-oriented 
economies and “money for the commons” that limit speculation, emphasize 
use-value over exchange-value, favor equity in human relations, and 
promote responsibility for the preservation of natural habitats. Our 
findings highlight the strengths of DLTs for a federated scaling of CPR 
governance frameworks that accommodates rather than obliterates cultural

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article analyzes the main problems and the solutions 
adopted in the market for Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), to anticipate 
the future of this market and determine implications for issuers, 
investors and regulators. ICOs represent an alternative and innovative 
financing solution that has experienced spectacular growth and notoriety
 in recent years. ICOs rely on Blockchain protocols and the ICO market 
is, therefore, characterized as decentralized, disintermediated and 
unregulated. Our results show that although the ICO market is 
innovative, it already displays many of the problems of traditional 
financial markets, and that these problems were at the genesis of the 
last financial crisis. Our analysis of the problems and solutions 
adopted shows a tension between what the Blockchain technology offers, 
and the problems associated with the financing of innovation. 
Considering the problems and solutions adopted, we no longer expect the 
ICO market to be characterized as disintermediated, unregulated or even 
decentralized in the near future. Furthermore, it is a real possibility 
that ICOs may end up being a progressor model eventually replaced by 
similar but more specialized financing models, some of which may already
 exist. With respect to the particular solutions of the ICO market, 
while some represent the realization of the potential of Blockchain, 
others such as forks have important Governance implications with the 
potential to create as many problems as the ones they address.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this commentary we explore how international development, 
disaster relief and climate change mitigation credentials are being 
called upon to justify ‘crypto-colonialism', whereby blockchain 
technology is used to extract economic benefits from those suffering the
 scars of colonial expansionism in the Global South. These benefits 
include land, labour and resources needed to facilitate local 
‘crypto-utopian' developments, or a ‘green economy' elsewhere. As with 
past neoliberal development agendas imposing structural economic 
reforms, the contemporary crypto-colonial exercises discussed here are 
driven in pursuit of a common good – to protect the global commons and 
improve people's lives. Within spaces where crypto-colonialism 
manifests, the governance frameworks of the associated technology is 
heavily entangled with social-spatial relations in multiple ways. We 
argue that despite being distributed, techno-ecological fixes are never 
placeless. How people engage with, resist or reconfigure a 
crypto-economy is geographically contingent. This commentary argues for 
more situated critical analysis of actually existing case-studies to 
reveal the inequitable terrain of project benefit distributions, and to 
expose the likely winners and losers within each. The success or failure
 of use-cases is less dependent on technical viability, but rather 
mediated through reactions to colonial contexts and historical 
experiences of various economic and climate crises.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Abstract The supposed disruptive and transformational 
potential of blockchain technology has received widespread attention in 
the media, from legislators, and from academics across disciplines. 
While much of this attention has revolved around cryptocurrencies such 
as Bitcoin, many see the true promise of blockchain technology in its 
potential use for transactions in traditional assets, as well as for 
facilitating self-executing ‘smart contracts', which replace vague and 
imprecise natural language with unambiguous computer code. This article 
presents a simple legal argument against the feasibility of a meaningful
 blockchain-based economic system. Blockchain-based systems are shown to
 be unsuitable for transactions in traditional assets, unless design 
choices are made which render the use of the technology pointless. The 
same argument is shown to apply to smart contracts. Legal and practical 
obstacles therefore mean that, outside its original realm of 
cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is highly unlikely to transform 
economic interactions in the real world.</td>

						<td>The article argues for a sharp analytical distinction between 
the realms of technology and of law. The question to what extent the law
 'can' be digitalized relates to technology, whereas the question to

Against this backdrop, it is argued that digital technology does not 
challenge the law fundamentally. Instead, the crucial questions on the 
relationship between law and digitalization lie in the details. The 
article raises those questions and provides an analytical framework for 
the law of digitalization and the digitalization of law.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The author critically evaluates the impact and potential of a 
community currency-or local money system-known as the 'local exchange 
trading scheme' (LETS), to contribute to sustainable local development 
(SLD). Two distinct and contrasting models for sustainable development 
are described: a mainstream approach, focused on local regeneration 
[termed here the 'local economic development' (LED) approach]; and a 
radical 'green' or 'new economics' strategy (referred to as 'sustainable
 local development' or SLD). In the elaboration of these models the 
functions of community currencies within each perspective are outlined, 
and the basis for an evaluate framework is provided. Most previous 
analysis of LETS has used a broadly LED perspective; this paper focuses 
on an evaluation for SLD, as this has not previously been 
comprehensively done. For SLD, community currencies should enable people
 to: meet local needs through informal employment; revalue and redefine 
'work'; promote localisation and self-reliance; shift consumption 
patterns towards sharing, recycling, reuse, and reducing resource use; 
and build green social networks. Findings from a case-study LETS 
indicate that this community currency is successful in allowing 
participants to make small changes in their lifestyles, consumption, and
 employment patterns towards SLD, but there are limitations of size, 
scope, funding and management to be overcome before this could be 
achieved more effectively with LETS. However, following the LED-relevant
 prescriptions for upscaling and mainstreaming would undermine the 
qualities which align LETS with SLD perspective, and this highlights the
 importance of choosing appropriate evaluative frameworks, particularly 
when appraising sustainable-development initiatives.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is emerging as a new 
mechanism for settling the exchange of energy between renewable energy 
generators and consumers. P2P provides a mechanism for local balancing 
when it is facilitated through distributed ledgers (‘blockchains'). 
Energy communities across Europe have uncovered the potential of this 
technology and are currently running pilots to test its applicability in
 P2P energy trading. The aim of this paper is to assess, using legal 
literature and legislation, whether the legal forms available to energy 
communities in the United Kingdom (UK) can help resolve some of the 
uncertainties around the individual use of blockchain for P2P energy 
trading. This includes the legal recognition of ‘prosumers', the 
protection of their personal data, as well as the validity of ‘smart 
contracts' programmed to trade energy on the blockchain network. The 
analysis has shown that legal entities, such as Limited Liability 
Partnerships and Co-operative Societies, can play a crucial role in 
providing the necessary framework to protect consumers engaging in these
 transactions. This is particularly the case for co-operatives, given 
that they can hold members liable for not respecting the rules set out 
in their (compulsory) governing document. These findings are relevant to
 other European countries, where the energy co-operative model is also 
used.</td>

						<td>Meeting on the second anniversary of the Paris Agreement 
signing in 2017, the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat founded 
the Climate Chain Coalition (CCC). Backed by a number of 
multi-stakeholder groups like the Blockchain for Climate Foundation, the
 Ottawa-based CCC promotes the 'blockchainization' of the Paris 
Agreement. What kind of 'cooler' world do blockchain-based climate 
governance projects conjure? This paper scrutinizes the shared visions 
materializing across climate finance experiments, locating them largely 
within existing individualistic imaginaries rather than more 
collectivistic alternatives. It finds the imaginaries of 'cool' 
technological experimentation to fall short in materializing broader 
input and more effective output required to overcome the legitimacy 
crisis facing market-led climate governance.</td>

						<td>Critical effects of global climate change urgently call for 
socio-technical transitions towards more efficient, flexible and cleaner
 energy systems. However, adequate regulatory frameworks and policy 
incentives are lagging behind. This paper focuses on the governance 
dynamics shaping technology-enabled transitions towards distributed

role of blockchain technology in enhancing the governance of 
sociotechnical energy transitions. For this, the paper reviews: (1) the 
governance arrangements shaping distributed energy transitions, (2) the 
emergence of blockchain-based solutions in the energy sector (focusing 
on P2P energy trading platforms) and, (3) the role of the blockchain in 
overcoming the governance limitations of distributed energy transitions.
 The study addresses emerging but interrelated niches of academic study 
from an integral conceptualization and synthesis of the literature. 
Rather than extensively covering these fields of research, the purpose 
is to connect these areas of academic knowledge and expand the 
theoretical understanding stemming from this convergence. The findings 
show the potential of blockchain-based governance to overcome 
institutional barriers related to trust-building and enhanced 
coordination for community-based energy transitions.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper explores activism enacted through Silk Road, a now 
defunct cryptomarket where illicit drugs were sold in the dark web. 
Drawing on a digital ethnography of Silk Road, we develop the notion of 
constructive activism to extend the lexicon of concepts available to 
discuss forms of online activism. Monitoring of the cryptomarket took 
place between June 2011 and its closure in October 2013. Just before and
 after the closure of the marketplace we conducted anonymous online 
interviews with 17 people who reported buying drugs on Silk Road (1.0). 
These interviews were conducted synchronously and interactively through 
encrypted instant messaging. Participants discussed harnessing and 
developing the technological tools needed to access Silk Road and engage
 within the Silk Road community. For participants Silk Road was not just
 a market for trading drugs: it facilitated a shared experience of 
personal freedom within a libertarian philosophical framework, where 
open discussions about stigmatized behaviours were encouraged and 
supported. Tensions between public activism against drug prohibition and
 the need to hide one's identity as a drug user from public scrutiny 
were partially resolved through community actions that internalized 
these politics, rather than engaging in forms of online activism that 
are intended to have real-world political effects. Most aptly described 
through van de Sande's (2015) concept of prefigurative politics, they 
sought to transform their values into built environments that were 
designed to socially engineer a more permissive digital reality, which 
we refer to as constructive activism.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The paper analyzes legal issues associated with the 
application of existing contract law provisions to so-called Smart 
contracts, defined in the paper as ‘agreements existing in the form of 
software code implemented on the Blockchain platform, which ensures the 
autonomy and self-executive nature of Smart contract terms based on a 
predetermined set of factors'. The paper consists of several sections. 
In the second section, the paper outlines the peculiarities of 
Blockchain technology, as currently implemented in Bitcoin 
cryptocurrency, which forms the core of Smart contracts. In the third 
section, the main characteristic features of Smart contracts are 
described. Finally, the paper outlines key tensions between classic 
contract law and Smart contracts. The concluding section sets the core 
question for analysis of the perspectives of implementation of this 
technology by governments: ‘How to align the powers of the government 
with Blockchain if there is no central authority but only distributed 
technologies'. The author suggests two solutions, neither of which is 
optimal: (1) providing the state authorities with the status of a 
Superuser with extra powers; and (2) relying on traditional remedies and
 enforcement practices, by pursuing specific individuals–parties to a 
Smart contract–in offline mode.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Smart contracts lie at the heart of blockchain technology. 
There are two principal problems, however, with existing smart 
contracts: First, the enforceability of smart contracts remains 
ambiguous. Second, smart contracts are limited in scope and capability 
barring more complex contracts from being executed via blockchain 
technology. Drawing from the existing literature on contracts and smart 
contracting, this Article suggests new approaches to address these two 
problems. First, it proposes a framework based on reliance-based 
contracting to analyze smart contracts. Second, the Article analyzes the
 seismic shifts in contractual disputes, and offers new insights into 
its features including decentralized decision-making, network-based 
dispute resolution, and extrajudicial enforcement of decisions. The 
Article concludes that users' reliance should be the basis for analysis 
of smart contracts and its associated dispute resolution mechanism.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Bitcoin was created in 2008 to serve as an alternative payment
 mechanism for both the under-banked and un-banked, or those in regions 
where the formal financial system suffers from broad corruption and 
efficient regulation. However, criminals and terrorists quickly 
exploited Bitcoin's unique properties, namely its peer-to-peer nature 
and pseudo-anonymity, to facilitate extensive terrorist financing and 
money laundering schemes. Government reactions to safeguard national 
security interests have been extremely varied, ranging from outright 
bans to passive tolerance. This inconsistency stems from how to 
effectively classify Bitcoin. On one side are those who argue Bitcoin is
 a currency, and on the other are those who claim it is a type of asset.
 In the US alone, these discrepancies have led to a bureaucratic turf 
war between different regulatory bodies, namely the Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network, the Commodity Futures Trading Association, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Internal Revenue Service. 
This study seeks to move beyond the existing legal frameworks, arguing 
that Bitcoin should be classified as a technology and regulation should 
rest with private sector technology companies.</td>

						<td>This dissertation is based on a longitudinal ethnographic and 
netnographic study of the Bitcoin and broader Blockchain community. The 
data is drawn from 38 in-depth interviews and 200+ informal interviews, 
plus archival news media sources, netnography, and participant 
observation conducted in multiple cities: Toronto, Amsterdam, Berlin, 
Miami, New York, Prague, San Francisco, Cancun, Boston/Cambridge, and 
Tokyo. Participation at Bitcoin/Blockchain conferences included: 
Consensus Conference New York, North American Bitcoin Conference, 
Satoshi Roundtable Cancun, MIT Business of Blockchain, and Scaling 
Bitcoin Tokyo. The research fieldwork was conducted between 2014-2018. 
The dissertation is structured as three papers: - Satoshi is Dead. Long 
Live Satoshi. The Curious Case of Bitcoin: This paper focuses on the 
myth of anonymity and how by remaining anonymous, Satoshi Nakamoto, was 
able to leave his creation open to widespread adoption. - Tracing the 
United Nodes of Bitcoin: This paper examines the intersection of 
religiosity, technology, and money in the Bitcoin community. - Our Brand
 Is Crisis: Creation and Resilience of Decentralized Brands Bitcoin 
&amp; the Blockchain: Drawing on ecological resilience framework as a 
conceptual metaphor this paper maps how various stabilizing and 
destabilizing forces in the Bitcoin ecosystem helped in the evolution of
 a decentralized brand and promulgated more mainstreaming of the Bitcoin
 brand.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Since Edward Snowden's revelations of US and UK surveillance 
programs, privacy advocates, progressive security engineers, and policy 
makers have been seeking to win majority support for countering 
surveillance. The problem is framed as the replacement of targeted 
surveillance with mass surveillance programs, and the solutions put 
forward are predominantly technical and involve the use of encryption – 
or ‘crypto' – as a defense mechanism. The counter-surveillance movement 
is timely and deserves widespread support. However, as this article will
 argue and illustrate, raising the specter of an Orwellian system of 
mass surveillance, shifting the discussion to the technical domain, and 
couching that shift in economic terms undermine a political reading that
 would attend to the racial, gendered, classed, and colonial aspects of 
the surveillance programs. Our question is as follows: how can this 
specific discursive framing of counter-surveillance be re-politicized 
and broadened to enable a wider societal debate informed by the 
experiences of those subjected to targeted surveillance and associated 
state violence?</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>[...]the factors under consideration by the regulators in 
making these assessments include:55 * whether the platform is structured
 so that there is intended to be and is delivery of crypto assets to 
investors; * if there is delivery, when that occurs, and whether it is 
to an investor's wallet over which the platform does not have control or
 custody; * whether investors' crypto assets are pooled together with 
those of other investors and with the assets of the platform; * whether 
the platform or a related party holds or controls the investors' assets;
 * if the platform holds or stores assets for its participants, how the 
platform makes use of those assets; * whether the investor can trade, or
 rollover positions held by the platform, and having regard to the legal
 arrangements between the platform and its participants, the actual 
functions of the platform and the manner in which transactions occur on 
it; * who has control or custody of crypto assets; * who is the legal 
owner of such crypto assets; and * what rights investors will have in 
the event of the platform's insolvency. (b) The Proposed Regulatory 
Framework (i) Overview The proposed framework is based on the existing 
regulatory framework applicable to marketplaces in Canada. [...]it is 
worth noting that in instances where a platform does not take custody of
 digital-assets on behalf of its users, insurance may not even be 
necessary.145 The idea was also proposed to devise an insurance scheme 
similar to the CDIC, in which crypto asset platforms would be required 
to participate, with reasonable premiums and strict parameters.146 If 
not a long-term solution, this approach could nonetheless be useful in 
the short term to provide insurance to these platforms while the market 
for insurance adjusts to this industry. [...]the CDCC "is concerned that
 the Proposed Platform Framework may stifle these innovations, which are
 designed to protect personal information and reduce transaction costs, 
by imposing a traditional model of financial regulation onto Platforms. 
"158 Specific tools have yet to be developed, but the commentary 
suggests that all the pieces are there to build them. Because there are 
significant differences in the risks that exist between traditional and 
decentralized clearing, it was suggested that decentralized exchanges 
should be subject to KYC and AML compliance measures that appropriately 
reflect their business models.159 The CDCC recommends using new models 
for digital identity and digital transaction security that have the 
potential to dramatically enhance the security for these types of 
trades, rather than following the usual KYC and AML protocol.160 
Coincidentally, and as we are about to discuss, traditional KYC and AML 
protocol in Canada just went through an upgrade.</td>

			<h2>Crypto-giving and surveillance philanthropy: Exploring the trade-offs in blockchain innovation for nonprofits</h2>

					<tr>
					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>A blockchain is a smart electronic database, distributed to 
all users, immutably tracking every transaction that has ever taken 
place between nodes on a network. The technology is being used by some 
nonprofits to address various operational challenges, including 
attaching automated conditions to charitable donations facilitated by 
programmable “crypto-giving” platforms. Drawing from analysis of 
technical documents provided by active crypto-giving projects, this 
review considers how these platforms enable radical shifts in sectoral 
power relations through “surveillance philanthropy”. This algorithmic 
surveillance ensures project funding fully reflects the interests of 
donors, while potentially restricting nonprofits in meeting the dynamic 
and complex needs of project beneficiaries. The paper considers the 
benefit trade-offs from crypto-giving platforms in three areas of 
utilization: (a) new forms of donor engagement and fundraising, (b) new 
tools for organizational governance, and (c) novel provision of 
development assistance. Despite the possible efficiency and transparency
 benefits of crypto-giving platforms, more research and practitioner 
engagement is required to ensure the sector's funding is secure and 
sustainable, without entailing significant risks for proposed 
beneficiaries.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this commentary, we explore how blockchain is being 
leveraged to address the fundamental problems with market-based forest 
protection globally. In doing so, we consider the ways ‘cryptocarbon' 
initiatives are creating new challenges that have so far escaped 
critical scrutiny. A blockchain is a distributed and immutable 
electronic database – a ledger of every transaction that has ever taken 
place on a network, stored as cryptographically secured blocks, strung 
together in a chain. The technology is being increasingly hyped as 
applicable for a whole range of industries, social service provisions, 
and environmental management concerns. This includes the facilitation of
 natural asset market mechanisms, like Reducing Emissions from 
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). The original aim of REDD+ 
was to incentivise conservation, making tropical forests more valuable 
standing than cut down. Multiple factors, including lack of consumer 
interest, created an oversupply of carbon commodities. Ninety-five 
percent of the world's avoided deforestation credits, representing 
millions of hectares of conserved forest, were stuck without a buyer. 
Several flagging REDD+ projects are now hoping that blockchain 
technology can carry them to new heights of market capitalisation. 
However, like with any powerful new technology, the benefits remain 
ambiguous.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Cryptocurrency fraud has become a growing global concern, with
 various governments reporting an increase in the frequency of and 
losses from cryptocurrency scams. Despite increasing fraudulent activity
 involving cryptocurrencies, research on the potential of 
cryptocurrencies for fraud has not been examined in a systematic study. 
This review examines the current state of knowledge about what kinds of 
cryptocurrency fraud currently exist, or are expected to exist in the 
future, and provides comprehensive definitions of the frauds identified.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The theoretical foundations of bitcoin have been frequently 
traced back to the Austrian school of economics. To the extent that 
cryptocurrencies are not issued by a centralized authority and do not 
rely on an official legal tender status for their acceptance, they may 
indeed appear as a dramatic departure from the historical trend that has
 led, over the past few centuries, to the making of national money and 
as a decisive step toward the “denationalization of money” advocated by 
F. A. von Hayek. This article investigates to what extent bitcoin truly 
embodies the principles of stable money prescribed by Hayek and whether 
the proliferation of cryptocurrencies constitutes a Hayekian monetary 
competition.</td>

						<td>AbstractBlockocracies are a coherent, distinctive and novel 
organizational form bound by a collective ledger and a cryptocurrency. 
We frame our analysis of blockocracies against Weber's enduring 
description of bureaucracy, identifying those features of Weberian 
bureaucracies that are present, absent or marginalized in blockocracies.
 In contrast to bureaucracy's monocratic authority structure, authority 
in blockocracies is centered on four distinct layers. In each layer, 
there is governance of the code and governance by the code, and in the 
latter we distinguish between endogenous and exogenous rules. We also 
compare the “blockocrat” with Weber's depiction of the bureaucrat.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>True cryptocurrency believers posit a world with virtually 
limitless applications for the block chain. They tout the prospect of a 
globally accepted currency that works with lightning speed, costs 
virtually nothing, and guarantees 100% security and anonymity while 
eliminating the need to trust third parties. So far, the reality of 
cryptocurrency has not lived up to its hype. It turns out that 
cryptocurrency transactions can be slow, and expensive, because the 
blockchain, scales poorly. However, the really interesting divergence 
between pitch and reality has to do with the purported consequences of 
decentralization — the claim that bitcoin obviates the need for trust. 
This article interrogates the claim that trust can be replaced with 
blockchain technology. It tests the claims that Bitcoin eliminates the 
need for trust against real world experiences of Bitcoin holders and 
markets. It documents the many points at which cryptocurrencies shifts 
the locus of embedded trust, rather than eliminating the need for such 
trust. Finally, the article concludes that rather than replacing trust, 
cryptocurrencies instead require users to repose their trust in less 
transparent, less reliable and less accountable parties.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>There are different studies that point out that the price of 
electricity is a fundamental factor that will influence the mining 
decision, due to the cost it represents. There is also an ongoing debate
 about the pollution generated by cryptocurrency mining, and whether or 
not the use of renewable energies will solve the problem of its 
sustainability. In our study, starting from the Environmental 
Performance Index (EPI), we have considered several determinants of 
cryptocurrency mining: energy price, how that energy is generated, 
temperature, legal constraints, human capital, and R&amp;D&amp;I. From 
this, via linear regression, we recalculated this EPI by including the 
above factors that affect cryptocurrency mining in a sustainable way. 
The study determines, once the EPI has been readjusted, that the most 
sustainable countries to perform cryptocurrency mining are Denmark and 
Germany. In fact, of the top ten countries eight of them are European 
(Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Austria, and the United
 Kingdom); and the remaining two are Asian (South Korea and Japan).</td>

						<td>Cryptocurrency mining uses significant amounts of energy as 
part of the proof-of-work time-stamping scheme to add new blocks to the 
chain. Expanding upon previously calculated energy use patterns for 
mining four prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and
 Monero), we estimate the per coin economic damages of air pollution 
emissions and associated human mortality and climate impacts of mining 
these cryptocurrencies in the US and China. Results indicate that in 
2018, each $1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for $0.49 in 
health and climate damages in the US and $0.37 in China. The similar 
value in China relative to the US occurs despite the extremely large 
disparity between the value of a statistical life estimate for the US 
relative to that of China. Further, with each cryptocurrency, the rising
 electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost
 inevitable cliff of negative net social benefits, absent perpetual 
price increases. For example, in December 2018, our results illustrate a
 case (for Bitcoin) where the health and climate change “cryptodamages” 
roughly match each $1 of coin value created. We close with discussion of
 policy implications.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This thesis is about how the new techno-capitalist industries 
oriented around blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are further 
marginalizing already marginalized groups in Puerto Rico. These 
industries are forming new distributed cryptoeconomic geographies with 
highly local impacts. While socio-technical relationships with crypto 
and blockchain are forming all over the globe, the scenario in Puerto 
Rico has the most the most at stake for residents who do not have a 
stake in cryptocurrency. Specifically, a group of crypto-proponents 
(primarily male-dominated US expats) is looking to establish a new 
“crypto-utopia” in San Juan. These transactionary publics, as I define 
them, are groups with certain discourses, ideologies, and rhetorics 
centered around individual transactions, goals, and gains. They work 
through vastly different power structures that allow them to act more 
autonomously and anonymously via digital technology. However – there are
 local, native Puerto Ricans, government organizations, and institutions
 engaging as well on the basis of economic development. From a feminist 
perspective, this thesis challenges the assertion that blockchain 
technology has emancipatory potential, particularly for Puerto Rico. I 
discuss the resistance and contestation against crypto-colonialism and 
economic injustice in Puerto Rico, and highlight strategies both with 
and without digital technology. Specifically, I question if the politics
 of blockchain technology are compatible with those of platform 
cooperativism. I conclude with a number of speculative future scenarios 
for how alternate techno-economic strategies may play out in Puerto 
Rico, and what their consequences may be.</td>

						<td>This paper interrogates discourses associated with encryption 
in contemporary policy debates. It traces through three distinct 
cryptographic imaginaries – the occult, the state, and democratic values
 – and how each conceptualises what encryption is, what it does, and 
what it should do. Situating each imaginary in time through historical 
research, I consider how they foreground distinct configurations of 
power and authority. It concludes by describing the development of a new
 cryptographic imaginary, one which sees encryption as a necessary 
precondition for the formation of networked publics.</td>

						<td>Mainstream economics has consistently ignored the iconography 
of currency, describing money ‘just' as a commodity. The paper is going 
to investigate the economic and political significance of the 
representations of authority and nationality in currency describing how 
these representation support its acceptability. The aim of the analysis 
is double: to decipher the visual identity of currency and its 
contribution to the acceptance of money in day-to-day transactions, as 
well as to discuss the operational principles of the monetary system as 
they are uncovered in the iconography of money. By answering these 
questions, the paper is going to trace the theoretical presuppositions 
and the cultural stereotypes that inform the representation of economic 
value and national identity as they are articulated in banknotes and 
coins with a specific emphasis on the European Monetary Union and the 
recent financial crisis that is still affecting its periphery.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The Internet and other telecommunications systems have 
reshaped the means by which markets are accessed, generated, and 
transformed. Recent innovations in computer science have led to the 
development of a virtually bound, decentralized, encrypted currency 
system known as bitcoin. Unlike conventional currency systems, the 
Bitcoin protocol is cryptologically defined with a virtual structure 
that allows it to simultaneously operate as currency, commodity, and 
market shaping socio-political force. Its decentralized design permits 
it to function as a free-market response to fiat currencies vulnerable 
to inflation, regulation, and manipulation. Given the cultural 
significance anthropologists and other social scientists have assigned 
to various modes and mediums of exchange over the years, the 
socio-economic impact of this novel currency system warrants particular 
consideration. This research describes the Bitcoin community that has 
emerged alongside the currency, including the entrepreneurs, developers,
 and consumers who are dedicated to bitcoin's perpetuation and 
acceptance as an internationally recognized medium of exchange. 
Ethnographic interviews and participant observation were utilized to 
collect information from users in the Central Florida area, detailing 
their experiences and interactions with the Bitcoin protocol and its 
associated community. This research provides new levels of 
anthropological insight into currency development, market interaction, 
and economically embodied social commentary. Moreover, its exploratory 
nature helps create a viable framework around which qualitative inquiry 
of virtual crypto-currencies may be designed in future studies.</td>

			<h2>Cutting the network? Facebook's Libra currency as a problem of organisation</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This essay explores the organisational character of Facebook's
 Libra currency by undertaking a critical reading of documents published
 by the Libra Association. Drawing on the conceptual work of Marilyn 
Strathern and Michel Serres, it illustrates how ownership cuts the 
network and encourages parasitism as a means of driving future profit. 
Central to this is the claim that Libra is not an exercise in 
democratising money, but rather, the opposite: Libra is run as a club, 
for the benefit of club members. The conceptual theme of 'cutting' is 
used to organise the argument. Rather than a cutting-edge technology, 
Libra's true innovation is organisational and consists in overturning 
the decentralised character of blockchain, such that distributed ledger 
technology is re-centralised by big tech firms. Outsiders are thus 
cut-off from Libra; only those inside the club have the right to 
participate in Libra and its governance. This position also affords 
members an exclusive capacity to take a cut of the profits generated 
through Libra. As a private organisation, members have sole rights to 
future profits generated from the Libra ecosystem and are in this way 
incentivised to create new product opportunities over time.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Background. There is a historical narrative of fear 
surrounding cybercrime. This has extended to cryptocurrencies (CCs), 
which are often viewed as a criminal tool. Aim. To carry out the first 
user study of CCs for illicit activity, from the perspective of 
underground and dark net forums. Method. We conducted a qualitative 
study, using a content analysis method, of 16,405 underground and dark 
net forum posts selected from CrimeBB, a dataset of 100 million posts 
curated by the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre. Results. Firstly, finality 
of payments emerged as a major motivator for the use of CCs. Second, we 
propose an Operational Security Taxonomy for Illicit Internet Activity 
to show that CCs are only one part of several considerations that 
combine to form security in illicit internet transactions. Third, the 
dark net is hard to use and requires significant study, specialist 
equipment and advanced knowledge to achieve relative security. 
Conclusion. We argue that finality is the main advantage of CCs for this
 user group, not anonymity as widely thought. The taxonomy shows that 
banning CCs is unlikely to be effective. Finally, we contend that the 
dark net is a niche for criminal activity and fears over cybercrime 
cause the threat to be exaggerated.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The cypherpunks were 1990s digital activists who challenged 
White House policies aiming to prevent the emergence of unregulated 
digital cryptography, an online privacy technology capable of 
frustrating government surveillance. Whilst the cypherpunk's ideology, 
which is predominantly the output of Timothy C. May, is well understood,
 less is known about the composition of the cypherpunk's community. This
 article builds on past studies by Rid and Beltramini by using the 
cypherpunk's mail list archive to profile the most active and 
influential cypherpunks. This study confirms the May-derived ideology is
 broadly, though not entirely, representative of the cypherpunk 
community. This article assesses the cypherpunks were a highly educated,
 mostly libertarian community permeated by aspects of anarchism which 
arose from a societal disaffiliation inherited from the counterculture. 
This article further argues that the cypherpunks were also influenced by
 the hacker ethic and dystopian science fiction.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Drawing on an empirical study of cryptocurrency white papers, 
this paper proposes an actor-based taxonomy of cryptocurrency 
blockchains. First, it describes the evolution of blockchain 
architecture with reference to the economic services that blockchains 
supply. Second, it discusses the socio-technical platform of blockchains
 as proposed in cryptocurrency white papers. Third, it analyses the 
socio-economic consequences of these technically diverse blockchain 
platforms, by proposing a taxonomy of their digital architectures in 
reference to two groups of actors that maintain blockchain 
infrastructure: transactioners and accountants. Defining cryptocurrency 
as data money, and locating cryptocurrency ownership as the possession 
of an exclusive right to move data privately in a public or private 
space, the paper describes a blockchain as a digital actor-network 
platform that makes it possible to define and distribute these data 
transfer rights.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The vast transactional, trust and security advantages of 
Bitcoin are dwarfed by the intentionally resource-intensive design in 
its transaction verification process which now threatens the climate we 
depend upon for survival. Indeed Bitcoin mining and transactions are an 
application of Blockchain technology employing an inefficient use of 
scarce energy resources for a financial activity at a point in human 
development where world governments are scrambling to reduce energy 
consumption through their Paris Agreement climate change commitments and
 beyond to mitigate future climate change implications. Without 
encouraging more sustainable development of the potential applications 
of Blockchain technologies which can have significant social and 
economic benefits, their resource-intensive design combined now pose a 
serious threat to the global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas 
emissions. The article examines government intervention choices to 
desocialise negative environmental externalities caused by high-energy 
consuming Blockchain technology designs. The research question explores 
how to promote the environmentally sustainable development of 
applications of Blockchain without damaging this valuable sector. It 
studies existing regulatory and fiscal policy approaches towards digital
 currencies in order to provide a basis for further legal and policy 
tools targeted at mitigating energy consumption of Blockchain 
technologies. The article concludes by identifying appropriate fiscal 
policy options for this purpose, as well as further considerations on 
the potential for Blockchain technology in climate change mitigation.</td>

			<h2>Decentralisation, Distrust &amp; Fear of the Body – The Worrying Rise of Crypto-Law</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The increasing collective use of distributed application 
software platforms, programming languages and crypto-currencies around 
the blockchain concept for general transactions may have radical 
implications for the way in which society conceptualises and applies 
trust and trust-based social systems such as law. By exploring one 
iteration of such generalised blockchain systems - Ethereum - and the 
historical lineage of such systems, it will be argued that indeed their 
ideological basis is largely one of distrust, decentralisation and, 
ultimately, via increasing disassociation of identity, a fear of the 
body itself. This ideological basis can be reframed as a crypto-legal 
approach to the problems of human interaction, one whereby the purely 
technological solutions outlined above are considered adequate for 
reconciling many of the problems of our collective existence. The 
article concludes, however, by re-iterating a perspective of law more so
 as an entirely embodied and trust dependent notion. These aspects go 
some way to explaining the necessarily centralised role it takes on 
within societies. They also explain why the crypto-legal approaches 
advanced by systems like Ethereum - or even the co-opting of blockchain 
technology by law firms themselves - will only ever be at best 
efficiency exercises concerned with the processing of data relating to 
legal affairs, and not the more radical, ambiguous and difficult process
 of actual legal thought or, indeed, engagement with trust.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Decentralisation as a concept is attracting a lot of interest,
 not least with the rise of decentralised and distributed techno-social 
systems like Bitcoin, and distributed ledgers more generally. In this 
paper, we first define decentralisation as it is implemented for 
technical architectures and then discuss the technical, social, 
political and economic ideas that drive the development of 
decentralised, and in particular, distributed systems. We argue that 
technical efforts towards decentralisation tend to go hand-in-hand with 
ambitions for rearranging power dynamics. We caution, however, against 
simplistic understandings of power in relation to the 
decentralisation-centralisation spectrum, and argue that in practice, 
decentralisation might very well be served by and produce centralising 
effects. The paper then goes on to discuss the critical literature that 
highlights some of the common assumptions and critiques made about 
decentralisation and the pros and cons of a decentralised approach. 
Finally, we propose some of the missing parts to current debates about 
decentralisation, and argue for a more nuanced and grounded approach to 
the centralisation/decentralisation dichotomy.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>It has been suggested that the development of decentralised 
autonomous organisations (DAOs) will lead to a paradigm shift in the way
 we perceive businesses. DAOs ostensibly eliminate agency costs due to 
the absence of a board of directors, automated governance mechanisms and
 transparency provided by the blockchain upon which the DAO is launched.
 This article undertakes a comparative analysis between DAOs and 
corporations and questions whether DAOs really do improve the corporate 
form. Using a corporate governance and legal realist lens, this article 
suggests that a number of the purported benefits of DAOs are overly 
simplified. Moreover, there are several practical and legal obstacles 
that technological advancements and improved engineering must overcome 
before DAOs become a viable, mainstream organisational structure. 
Balancing the inevitable improvement in technology against these 
significant obstacles, this article predicts an incremental integration 
of DAOs into society through a hybrid approach, involving interim legal 
solutions and varying degrees of automation and decentralisation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Decentralization is a term widely used in a variety of 
contexts, particularly in political science and discourses surrounding 
the Internet. It is popular today among advocates of blockchain 
technology. While frequently employed as if it were a technical term, 
decentralization more reliably appears to operate as a rhetorical 
strategy that directs attention toward some aspects of a proposed social
 order and away from others. It is called for far more than it is 
theorized or consistently defined. This non-specificity has served to 
draw diverse participants into common political and technological 
projects. Yet even the most apparently decentralized systems have shown 
the capacity to produce economically and structurally centralized 
outcomes. The rhetoric of decentralization thus obscures other aspects 
of the re-ordering it claims to describe. It steers attention from where
 concentrations of power are operating, deferring worthwhile debate 
about how such power should operate. For decentralization to be a 
reliable concept in formulating future social arrangements and related 
technologies, it should come with high standards of specificity. It also
 cannot substitute for anticipating centralization with appropriate 
mechanisms of accountability.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Just as decentralization communication systems lead to the 
creation of the Internet, today a new technology — the blockchain — has 
the potential to decentralize the way we store data and manage 
information, potentially leading to a reduced role for one of the most 
important regulatory actors in our society: the middleman. Blockchain 
technology enables the creation of decentralized currencies, 
self-executing digital contracts (smart contracts) and intelligent 
assets that can be controlled over the Internet (smart property). The 
blockchain also enables the development of new governance systems with 
more democratic or participatory decision-making, and decentralized 
(autonomous) organizations that can operate over a network of computers 
without any human intervention. These applications have led many to 
compare the blockchain to the Internet, with accompanying predictions 
that this technology will shift the balance of power away from 
centralized authorities in the field of communications, business, and 
even politics or law. In this Article, we explore the benefits and 
drawbacks of this emerging decentralized technology and argue that its 
widespread deployment will lead to expansion of a new subset of law, 
which we term Lex Cryptographia: rules administered through 
self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (autonomous) 
organizations. As blockchain technology becomes widely adopted, 
centralized authorities, such as governmental agencies and large 
multinational corporations, could lose the ability to control and shape 
the activities of disparate people through existing means. As a result, 
there will be an increasing need to focus on how to regulate blockchain 
technology and how to shape the creation and deployment of these 
emerging decentralized organizations in ways that have yet to be 
explored under current legal theory.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>DeFi (‘decentralized finance') has joined FinTech (‘financial 
technology'), RegTech (‘regulatory technology'), cryptocurrencies, and 
digital assets as one of the most discussed emerging technological 
evolutions in global finance. Yet little is really understood about its 
meaning, legal implications, and policy consequences. In this article we
 introduce DeFi, put DeFi in the context of the traditional financial 
economy, connect DeFi to open banking, and end with some policy 
considerations. We suggest that decentralization has the potential to 
undermine traditional forms of accountability and erode the 
effectiveness of traditional financial regulation and enforcement. At 
the same time, we find that where parts of the financial services value 
chain are decentralized, there will be a reconcentration in a different 
(but possibly less regulated, less visible, and less transparent) part 
of the value chain. DeFi regulation could, and should, focus on this 
reconcentrated portion of the value chain to ensure effective oversight 
and risk control. Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, in 
fact DeFi requires regulation in order to achieve its core objective of 
decentralization. Furthermore, DeFi potentially offers an opportunity 
for the development of an entirely new way to design regulation: the 
idea of ‘embedded regulation'. Regulatory approaches could be built into
 the design of DeFi, thus potentially decentralizing both finance and 
its regulation, in the ultimate expression of RegTech.</td>

						<td>The term decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to an alternative
 financial infrastructure built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. DeFi 
uses smart contracts to create protocols that replicate existing 
financial services in a more open, interoperable, and transparent way. 
This article highlights opportunities and potential risks of the DeFi 
ecosystem. I propose a multi-layered framework to analyze the implicit 
architecture and the various DeFi building blocks, including token 
standards, decentralized exchanges, decentralized debt markets, 
blockchain derivatives, and on-chain asset management protocols. I 
con-clude that DeFi still is a niche market with certain risks but that 
it also has interesting properties in terms of efficiency, transparency,
 accessibility, and composability. As such, DeFi may potentially 
contribute to a more robust and transparent financial infrastructure.

						<td>Global financial markets are in the midst of a transformative 
movement. The creation of Bitcoin and Facebook's proposed distribution 
of Diem mark a watershed moment in the evolution of the financial 
markets ecosystem. Purportedly, peer-to-peer distributed digital ledger 
technology eliminates legacy financial market intermediaries such as 
investment banks, depository banks, exchanges, clearinghouses, and 
broker-dealers. Yet careful examination reveals that cryptocurrency 
issuers and the firms that offer secondary market cryptocurrency trading
 services have not quite lived up to their promise. Notwithstanding 
crypto-enthusiasts' calls for disintermediation, evidence reveals that 
platforms that facilitate cryptocurrency trading frequently employ the 
long-adopted intermediation practices of their traditional counterparts.
 In fact, when emerging technologies fail, cryptocoin and token trading 
platforms partner with and rely on traditional financial services firms.
 As a result, these platforms face many of the</td>

						<td>The rise of centralized mining pools for risk sharing does not
 necessarily undermine the decentralization required for blockchains: 
because of miners' cross-pool diversification and pool managers' 
endogenous fee setting, larger pools better internalize their 
externality on global hash rates, charge higher fees, attract 
disproportionately fewer miners, and grow more slowly. Instead, mining 
pools as a financial innovation escalate miners' arms race and 
significantly increase the energy consumption of proof-of-work-based 
blockchains. Empirical evidence from Bitcoin mining supports our model's
 predictions. The economic insights inform other consensus protocols and
 the industrial organization of mainstream sectors with similar 
characteristics but ambiguous prior findings.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Advancements in the digital domain, for example, in blockchain
 technology, big data, and machine learning, are increasingly shaping 
the lives of individuals, groups, organizations, and societies. These 
developments call for effective governance to protect the basic 
interests and needs of these actors. Simultaneously, the very nature of 
governance is also changing. Policy-making is increasingly moving away 
from top-down governance by the state toward more horizontal modes of 
governance. This paper reviews the literature on governance theory in 
order to conceptualize governance as a mode of decentralized, networked 
regulation. We argue that the current dominant modes of governance are 
inadequate in understanding governance in the digital domain and are 
poorly equipped to conceptualize novel forms of governance such as 
decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Therefore, this study 
proposes a new mode of governance based on the regulation of new power 
relationships between the state and actors in the digital domain. This 
model further explores the role that blockchain technology can play in 
what we term decentralized network governance.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The terms decentralized organization and distributed 
organization are often used interchangeably, despite describing two 
distinct phenomena. I propose distinguishing decentralization, as the 
dispersion of organizational communications, from distribution, as the 
dispersion of organizational decision-making. Organizations can be 
distributed without being decentralized (and vice versa), and having 
multiple management layers directly affects only distribution – not 
decentralization. This proposed distinction has implications for 
understanding the growth of digital platforms (e.g. amazon.com ), which 
dominate the global economy in the 21 st century. While prominent 
platforms typically use machine learning as their core technology to 
transform inputs (e.g. data) into outputs (e.g. matchmaking services), 
blockchain has emerged as an alternative technological blueprint. I 
argue that blockchain enables platforms that are both decentralized and 
distributed (e.g. Bitcoin), whereas machine learning fosters centralized
 communications and the concentration of decision-making (e.g. Facebook 
Inc.). This distinction has crucial implications for antitrust policy, 
which, I contend, should shift both its analysis and its target of 
action away from the corporate level and focus instead on the data 
level. Based on this essay's framework, I make several predictions 
regarding the future of competition between centralized and 
decentralized platforms, the evolution of government regulation, and 
broader implications for managers in the digital economy and for the 
business schools charged with their education. I conclude with 
reflections on the opportunity to revive cybernetic thinking for 
preventing a dystopian future dominated by a handful of platform 
behemoths.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The vast majority of applications at this moment rely on 
centralized servers to relay messages between clients, where these 
servers are considered trusted third-parties. With the rise of 
blockchain technologies over the last few years, there has been a move 
away from both centralized servers and traditional federated models to 
more decentralized peer-to-peer alternatives. However, there appears to 
be a trilemma between security, scalability, and decentralization in 
blockchain-based systems. Deconstructing this trilemma using well-known 
threat models, we define a typology of centralized, federated, and 
decentralized architectures. Each of the different architectures has 
this trilemma play out differently. Facing a possible decentralized 
future, we outline seven hard problems facing decentralization and 
theorize that the differences between centralized, federated, and 
decentralized architectures depend on differing social interpretations 
of trust.</td>

						<td>This paper explores the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) 
ecosystem. We examine how DeFi is emerging on top of the public Ethereum
 smart contract platform, compare it to the centralized architecture of 
traditional financial markets and highlight opportunities and potential 
risks of this ecosystem. We propose a multi-layered framework to analyze
 the implicit architecture and the various DeFi building blocks, 
including token standards, decentralized exchanges, decentralized debt 
markets, blockchain derivatives and on-chain asset management protocols.
 We conclude that DeFi still is a niche market with certain risks, but 
also has interesting properties in terms of efficiency, transparency, 
accessibility and interoperability. As such, it may potentially 
contribute to a more robust and transparent financial infrastructure.</td>

						<td>This paper discusses the role of Deleuzian philosophy in 
fintech projects which operate ‘in the wild', i.e. far from the major 
institutional settings of fintech development, and which speculate 
towards an alternative financial economy, building upon algorithms, 
blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and crypto-assets. Based on ethnographic 
data collected with three different projects, I discuss the process of 
earmarking financial operations by means of philosophical concepts or 
theories, which enable the re-interpretation of the process of 
financialisation of everyday life. I further analyse the conceptual 
socialization of these technological endeavours with the wider-reaching 
theme of accelerating the capitalist process with the objective to 
overturn its excessive powers. The paper concludes by suggesting that 
fintech experiments which are socialized with accelerationist narratives
 re-interpret the process of financialisation as a path of liberation 
instead of exploitation, offering an escape from the capitalist crisis 
through machinic alchemy.</td>

						<td>Electronic waste is generating in the Bitcoin network at an 
alarming rate. This study identifies the determinants of electronic 
waste generation in the Bitcoin network using machine learning 
algorithms. We model the evolutionary patterns of electronic waste and 
carry out a predictive analytics exercise to achieve this objective. The
 Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and Generalized Mean Information 
Coefficient (GMIC) help to study the association structure. A series of 
six state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms - Gradient Boosting 
(GB), Regularized Random Forest (RRF), Bagging-Multiple Adaptive 
Regression Splines (BM), Hybrid Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (HYFIS), 
Self-Organizing Map (SOM), and Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN)
 are used separately for predictive modeling. We compare the predictive 
performance of all the algorithms. Statistically, the GB is a superior 
model followed by RRF. The performance of SOM is the least accurate. Our
 findings reveal that the blockchain's size, energy consumption, and the
 historical number of Bitcoin are the most determinants of electronic 
waste generation in the Bitcoin network. The overall findings bring out 
exciting insights into practical relevance for effectively curbing 
electronic waste accumulation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>duction This article situates the dark as a liminal and 
creative space of experimentation where tensions are generative and 
people tinker with emerging technologies to create alternative futures. 
Darkness need not mean chaos and fear of violence – it can mean privacy 
and protection. We define dark as an experimental space based upon 
uncertainties rather than computational knowns (Bridle) and then 
demonstrate via a case study of cryptocurrencies the contribution of 
dark and liminal social spaces to future(s)-making. Cryptocurrencies are
 digital cash systems that use decentralised (peer-to-peer) networking 
to enable irreversible payments (Maurer, Nelms, and Swartz). 
Cryptocurrencies are often clones or variations on the ‘original' 
Bitcoin payment systems protocol (Trump et al.) that was shared with the
 cryptographic community through a pseudonymous and still unknown 
author(s) (Nakamoto), creating a founder mystery. Due to the open 
creation process, a new cryptocurrency is relatively easy to make. 
However, many of them are based on speculative bubbles that mirror 
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ICOs' wealth creation. Examples of 
cryptocurrencies now largely used for speculation due to their 
volatility in holding value are rampant, with online clearing houses 
competing to trade hundreds of different assets from AAVE to ZIL. Many 
of these altcoins have little to no following or trading volume, leading
 to their obsolescence. Others enjoy immense popularity among dedicated 
communities of backers and investors. Consequently, while many 
cryptocurrency experiments fail or lack adoption and drop from the 
purview of history, their constant variation also contributes to the 
undertow of the future that pulls against more visible surface waves of 
computational progress. The article is structured to first define how we
 understand and leverage ‘dark' against computational cultures. We then 
apply thematic and analytical tactics to articulate future-making 
socio-technical experiments in the dark. Based on past empirical work of
 the authors (Maddox "Netnography") we focus on crypto-cultures' complex
 emancipatory and normative tensions via themes of construction, 
disruption, contention, redirection, obsolescence, and iteration. 
Through these themes we illustrate the mutation and absorption of dark 
experimental spaces into larger social structures. The themes we 
identify are not meant as a complete or necessarily serial set of 
occurrences, but nonetheless contribute a new vocabulary for students of
 technology and media to see into and grapple with the dark. Embracing 
the Dark: Prework &amp; Analytical Tactics for Outside the Known To 
frame discussion of the dark here as creative space for alternative 
futures, we focus on scholars who have deeply engaged with notions of 
socio-technical darkness. This allows us to explore outside the blinders
 of computational light and, with a nod to Sassen, dig in the shadows of
 known categories to evolve the analytical tactics required for the 
study of emerging socio-technical conditions. We understand the Dark Web
 to usher shifting and multiple definitions of darkness, from a moral 
darkness to a technical one (Gehl). From this work, we draw the 
observation of how technologies that obfuscate digital tracking create 
novel capacities for digital cultures in spaces defined by anonymity for
 both publisher and user. Darknets accomplish this by overlaying open 
internet protocols (e.g. TCP/IP) with non-standard protocols that 
encrypt and anonymise information (Pace). Pace traces concepts of 
darknets to networks in the 1970s that were 'insulated' from the 
internet's predecessor ARPANET by air gap, and then reemerged as 
software protocols similarly insulated from cultural norms around 
intellectual property. ‘Darknets' can also be considered in ternary as 
opposed to binary terms (Gehl and McKelvey) that push to make private 
that which is supposed to be public infrastructure, and push private 
platforms (e.g. a Personal Computer) to make public networks via common 
bandwidth. In this way, darknets feed new possibilities of communication
 from both common infrastructures and individual's platforms. Enabling 
new potentials of community online and out of sight serves to signal 
what the dark accomplishes for the social when measured against an 
otherwise unending light of computational society. To this point, a new 
dark age can be welcomed insofar it allows an undecided future outside 
of computational logics that continually define and refine the possible 
and probable (Bridle). This argument takes von Neumann's 1945 
declaration that “all stable processes we shall predict. All unstable 
processes we shall control” (in Bridle 21) as a founding statement for 
computational thought and indicative of current society. The hope 
expressed by Bridle is not an absence of knowledge, but an absence of 
knowing the future. Past the computational prison of total information 
awareness within an accelerating information age (Castells) is the 
promise of new formations of as yet unknowable life. Thus, from Bridle's
 perspective, and ours, darkness can be a place of freedom and 
possibility, where the equality of being in the dark, together, is not 
as threatening as current privileged ways of thinking would suggest 
(Bridle 15). The consequences of living in a constant glaring light lead
 to data hierarchies “leaching” (Bridle) into everything, including 
social relationships, where our data are relationalised while our 
relations are datafied (Maddox and Heemsbergen) by enforcing 
computational thinking upon them. Darkness becomes a refuge that 
acknowledges the power of unknowing, and a return to potential for 
social, equitable, and reciprocal relations. This is not to say that we 
envision a utopian life without the shadow of hierarchy, but rather an 
encouragement to dig into those shadows made visible only by the 
brightest of lights. The idea of digging in the shadows is borrowed from
 Saskia Sassen, who asks us to consider the ‘master categories' that 
blind us to alternatives. According to Sassen (402), while master 
categories have the power to illuminate, their blinding power keeps us 
from seeing other presences in the landscape: “they produce, then, a 
vast penumbra around that center of light. It is in that penumbra that 
we need to go digging”. We see darkness in the age of digital ubiquity 
as rejecting the blinding ‘master category' of computational thought. 
Computational thought defines social/economic/political life via what is
 static enough to predict or unstable enough to render a need to 
control. Otherwise, the observable, computable, knowable, and possible 
all follow in line. Our dig in the shadows posits a penumbra of 
protocols – both of computational code and human practice – that circle 
the blinding light of known digital communications. We use the remainder
 of this short article to describe these themes found in the dark that 
offer new ways to understand the movements and moments of potential 
futures that remain largely unseen. Thematic Resonances in the Dark This
 section considers cryptocultures of the dark. We build from a thematic 
vocabulary that has been previously introduced from empirical examples 
of the crypto-market communities which tinker with and through the 
darkness provided by encryption and privacy technologies (Maddox 
"Netnography"). Here we refine these future-making themes through their 
application to events surrounding community-generated technology aimed 
at disrupting centralised banking systems: cryptocurrencies (Maddox, 
Singh, et al.). Given the overlaps in collective values and technologies
 between crypto-communities, we find it useful to test the relevance of 
these themes to the experimental dynamics surrounding cryptocurrencies. 
We unpack these dynamics as construction, rupture and disruption, 
redirection, and the flip-sided relationship between obsolescence and 
iteration leading to mutation and absorption. This section provides a 
working example for how these themes adapt in application to a community
 dwelling at the edge of experimental technological possibilities. The 
theme of construction is both a beginning and a materialisation of a 
value field. It originates within the cyberlibertarians' ideological 
stance towards using technological innovations to ‘create a new world in
 the shell of the old' (van de Sande) which has been previously 
expressed through the concept of constructive activism (Maddox, Barratt,
 et al.). This libertarian ideology is also to be found in the early 
cultures that gave rise to cryptocurrencies. Through their interest in 
the potential of cryptography technologies related to social and 
political change, the Cypherpunks mailing list formed in 1992 (Swartz). 
The socio-cultural field surrounding cryptocurrencies, however, has 
always consisted of a diverse ecosystem of vested interests building 
collaborations from “goldbugs, hippies, anarchists, cyberpunks, 
cryptographers, payment systems experts, currency activists, commodity 
traders, and the curious” (Maurer, Nelms, and Swartz 262). Through the 
theme of construction we can consider architectures of collaboration, 
cooperation, and coordination developed by technically savvy 
populations. Cryptocurrencies are often developed as code by teams who 
build in mechanisms for issuance (e.g. ‘mining') and other controls 
(Conway). Thus, construction and making of cryptocurrencies tend to be 
collective yet decentralised. Cryptocurrencies arose during a time of 
increasing levels of distrust in governments and global financial 
instability from the Global Financial Crisis (20</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article explores the digitalization of traditional 
funeral joss paper into digital commodities through the case study of 
the Chinese online cemetery 00tang.com. Joss paper are paper replicas of
 everyday items such as money and objects that are ritually burned as a 
form of symbolic offering to the deceased in accordance with traditional
 Chinese practices of ancestor worship. Using both ethnographic 
interviews and discursive interface analysis, I look at how the 
remediation of spiritual joss paper into digital objects complicates 
perceived dichotomy between the gift and commodity that requires new 
ways of thinking about the acts of social reciprocity, indebtedness, and
 obligation. Drawing on established literature relating to gift and 
digital economies, I argue 00tang's digitization of joss paper on 
internet cemeteries is reflexive of the biopolitical means by which the 
state and market forces work to subsume traditional ancestor worship 
into controllable and commodifiable labor of mourning. Here, the 
subversive wastefulness of the gift is replaced by its accumulation and 
preservation online. Digitization in this regard highlights the process 
by which objects take on different materiality, values, aesthetics, and 
productive labor practices, all of which fundamentally alters the 
symbolic regimes of death and the ritual gift economy in China.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain technology is, in part, a proposal to resolve ‘the 
political' through technical means: decentralised networks to solve the 
problem of authority; cryptography to coordinate and secure the network;
 and game theory and incentive design to solve network behaviour. This 
PhD thesis draws on theoretical work by Karen Barad (2007) and Jacques 
Rancière (Rancière, 2010) to ask the question of what matters 
politically in blockchain technology – both in the sense of matter as 
becoming material of a new mediation of the political, but also 
mattering in the sense of being of political importance to engineers, 
developers and communities forming around blockchain as a potential. 
Rather than treating blockchain as coherent thing to be either 
celebrated or criticised, this thesis proposes and attempts to draw out 
the ways in which the potentials of blockchain are negotiated as part of
 its political effects, looking towards these negotiations to understand
 how political differences are made and sought materialised. Three 
approaches to the political are articulated to analyse Bitcoin and 
Ethereum as case studies and shift their terms of debate. Firstly, 
addressing the question of algorithmic determinacy, an approach is 
proposed for critically understanding a blockchain proposition that does
 not immediately revert to a competition of control between ‘human' and 
‘machine' through the notion of the insensible, drawing on work by 
geographer of the inhuman Yusoff (2013a). Secondly, drawing on political
 theorist Rancière (2010) a particular blockchain sensibility is 
articulated, addressing the question of the particular kind of 
‘disruption' that blockchain presents. Its specific provenance in 
political histories of decentralised network computation opens up 
political significance beyond its intersections with financial 
capitalism. Finally, addressing the question of blockchain as a 
resolution to the political, the thesis introduces the concept of 
dissensible as an ongoing potential for incompatible sensibilities and 
their negotiation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This commentary considers the challenges and trade-offs in 
using blockchain as the facilitating digital infrastructure for degrowth
 projects. A blockchain is simply a distributed database. The technology
 is being used for a wide range of applications relevant to economic 
exchange and environmental sustainability. Many degrowth scholars wholly
 reject technical fixes for politically induced environmental crises, 
seeing blockchain projects as wasteful and counter to convivial social 
relations. Others highlight the technology's potential for facilitating 
redistributive and regenerative economies, but without much detail. This
 paper argues that if blockchain is ever to prove useful for the 
degrowth movement it would need to overcome challenges in three 
important areas: 1) building democratic and (re)distributive economies, 
2) regenerating the environment without commodifying it, and 3) 
facilitating international alliances without imposing a particular set 
of values. What is certain is that technology on its own will not 
transcend the political struggles tackled by degrowth activists. 
However, under certain conditions, blockchain might make those struggles
 more effective.</td>

<ul>
<li>That the externalities I describe don't exist. You'll have a hard 
time proving that the waste of electricity and hardware, and the crime 
wave, are imaginary.</li>
<li>That although the externalities do exist, the benefits of 
decentralization outweigh them. The problem here is that since the 
systems are not actually decentralized, we get the externalities but 
don't get the benefits.</li>
<li>That although the externalities do exist, and the systems aren't 
dencentralized, they're making so much money that we shouldn't worry. 
The problem here is that the amount of actual money you can get out of a
 cryptocurrency equals the amount of actual money that has been put in, 
minus the actual costs of mining. So the big picture is that although 
there may be winners, in aggregate the system loses money.</li>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The enormous power consumption of Bitcoin has led to 
undifferentiated discussions in science and practice about the 
sustainability of blockchain and distributed ledger technology in 
general. However, blockchain technology is far from homogeneous—not only
 with regard to its applications, which now go far beyond 
cryptocurrencies and have reached businesses and the public sector, but 
also with regard to its technical characteristics and, in particular, 
its power consumption. This paper summarizes the status quo of the power
 consumption of various implementations of blockchain technology, with 
special emphasis on the recent ‘‘Bitcoin Halving” and so-called 
‘‘zk-rollups”. We argue that although Bitcoin and other proof-of-work 
blockchains do indeed consume a lot of power, alternative blockchain 
solutions with significantly lower power consumption are already 
available today, and new promising concepts are being tested that could 
further reduce in particulary the power consumption of large blockchain 
networks in the near future. From this we conclude that although the 
criticism of Bitcoin's power consumption is legitimate, it should not be
 used to derive an energy problem of blockchain technology in general. 
In many cases in which processes can be digitized or improved with the 
help of more energy-efficient blockchain variants, one can even expect 
net energy savings.</td>

			<h2>Embedding into an Emerging Money System: The Case of Bitcoin</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>As global economic crises place the issue of money at the 
forefront of media attention, a growing minority are turning to 
“cryptocurrencies” as an emerging digital alternative to state-issued 
currencies. Bitcoin, the most popular version of this emerging medium, 
is a useful proxy to answer a key question to the sociology of money: 
how do people embed themselves into an emerging money system, and what 
role does value play in this process? Drawing on 23 interviews with 
Bitcoin adopters, I find that embedding into Bitcoin is closely tied to 
personal experience and temporal contexts. This study demonstrates that 
the adoption of Bitcoin follows a distinct process. First adopters 
discover the value Bitcoin on their own terms. Next, they reflexively 
overcome challenges to these initial perceptions of value. Finally, they
 reaffirm their embeddedness in the system through rituals of 
commitment. This finding has implications for the sociology of money and
 economic sociology by distilling the connection between fictional 
expectations that are used to anchor value systems and the social 
construction of monetary utilities and group identities. Additionally, 
this connection helps to unpack how Bitcoin continues to mature as a 
money system despite being characterized by diverse adopters that often 
engage in economically inefficient activities.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>While scholars have studied the impacts of energy development 
booms on local communities in the U.S., much less is known about towns 
experiencing energy consumption booms from industries such as 
cryptocurrency mining. This article proposes that energy consumption 
boomtowns are unique in the risks, benefits, and conflicts they 
create—and that they provide fruitful areas of research for energy 
social scientists. We illustrate this point with a brief case study of 
Chelan County, Washington—where an influx of crypto mining over the past
 five years has stirred community debate. We collected more than 100 
newspaper articles, public comments, and public meeting recordings to 
identify the cautions, hesitations, and criticisms that have caused 
local regulators to take a precautionary approach. We highlight five key
 points of the debate that may be of interest to energy social 
scientists: (1) impacts on the local energy supply and prices, (2) 
unclear socioeconomic benefits to the county, (3) the illegitimacy of 
cryptocurrency, (4) environmental considerations, and (5) a disconnect 
with local legacy industries and community economic identity. We 
conclude by proposing areas of future social science research on energy 
consumption booms.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Bitcoin's energy hunger has triggered a passionate debate 
about the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies. Most studies have been
 focusing exclusively on Bitcoin and ignored the more than 500 further 
mineable coins and tokens. Here we analyze 20 cryptocurrencies, which 
account for more than 98% of the total market capitalization of 
cryptocurrencies. We conclude that Bitcoin accounts for 2/3 of the total
 energy consumption of cryptocurrencies and understudied 
cryptocurrencies represent the remaining 1/3.</td>

						<td>The Ethereum ecosystem is maintained by a distributed global

computational power. Previous work on estimating the energy use and 
emissions of the Ethereum network has relied on top-down economic 
analysis and rough estimates of hardware efficiency and emissions 
factors. In this work we provide a bottom-up analysis that works from 
hashrate to an energy usage estimate, and from mining locations to an 
emissions factor estimate, and combines these for an overall emissions 
estimate.</td>

			<h2>Evaluating complementary currencies: from the assessment of

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The phenomenon of complementary currencies has experienced in 
recent years a significant evolution both in terms of the sheer number 
of initiatives and in terms of their ability to attract the attention of
 academia, politics and media. The spread of these experiments and the 
increasing involvement of public institutions have led to a growing 
demand for evaluation procedures specifically targeted at CCs, both as 
economic experiments and as public policy initiatives. The task of 
evaluation confronts the peculiar multidimensional character of 
complementary currencies. One of the traits that is commonly recognized 
as a characteristic of CCs is indeed the presence, alongside more 
strictly economic dimensions, of multiple social dimensions and aims. 
Some evaluation models therefore attempt to measure—through the 
identification of multiple variables, and of corresponding 
indicators—the impacts of complementary currencies in terms of a wide 
range of expected social or economic objectives. This paper intends to 
question the sufficiency of similar approaches. We will argue that those
 approaches risk to overshadow a peculiar form of sociality which may 
emerge particularly in certain types of complementary currency 
experiments. The paper highlights the significance of this sociality and
 the relevance of its analysis for the advancement of evaluation 
practices in the field of monetary innovation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The platform economy1 is facing a crisis of accountability. 
Large Internet platforms, once regarded as sources of hope for 
democratic social movements or engines of a promising new economy—or, at
 worst, just superficial distractions—are now facing serious public 
scrutiny across the globe. The executives of Facebook, Google, and 
Twitter have been called before the U.S. Congress to account for their 
roles in enabling foreign election interference. Scholars have raised 
concerns about algorithmic, data-driven business models,2 the 
exploitation of digital labor,3 the abuse of market power,4 corporate 
governance failures,5 manipulation by oppressive governments,6 opacity 
and arbitrariness in content moderation,7 and corporate surveillance,8 
to name just a few in an ever-growing body of literature on the 
depredations of the platform economy. Part of the urgency surrounding 
such concerns lies in the fact that some platforms are near-impossible 
to escape. Internet users, and societies as a whole, have difficulty 
opting out of their services.9 Companies like Facebook, for instance, 
track users across the Web and create shadow user profiles even when the
 user does not have an account on their platforms.10 Not using such 
platforms means forgoing essential opportunities for work and social 
life—even access to basic services.11 By not using social media 
platforms such as Facebook, people deprive themselves of one of the 
“most powerful mechanisms” to make their voices heard.12 Conversely, for
 those who use such services, exit is not a costless exercise, as it 
involves the irrecoverable loss of social capital, reputational cachet, 
and assets.13</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The previous generation of shared protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, 
SMTP, etc.) produced immeasurable amounts of value, but most of it got 
captured and re-aggregated on top at the applications layer, largely in 
the form of data (think Google, Facebook and so on). The Internet stack,
 in terms of how value is distributed, is composed of “thin” protocols 
and “fat” applications.
This relationship between protocols and applications is reversed in the 
blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol 
layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the 
applications layer. It’s a stack with “fat” protocols and “thin” 
applications.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article suggests that it is advantageous for social 
scientists to deliberatedly depart from functionalist theories seeking 
to explain the expansion of financial instruments and logics across 
social life. Rather we identify three causes for financialization from 
three extant clusters of scholastic activity: an organic policial 
economy that sees finance expanding as a product or by-product of larger
 state and imperlial-level politcal strucggles, a prelational sociology 
that sees the ways that finance expands by becoming another medium for 
expressing and constraining social relationships, and a cultural 
analysis that observes the increasing redefinition of discursive and 
material practices as financial. Across this larger discussion, we 
introduce and situate the contributions to this journal's special issue 
on financialization.</td>

						<td>The article analyzes Bitcoin cryptocurrency as part of a new 
sector of the financial market, fintech 3.0. Subscribing to Maurizio 
Lazzarato's thesis that the category of the indebted man would be the 
form of governmentality of contemporary capitalism, it is discussed how 
Bitcoin works as a vector of expansion of the social logic of 
indebtedness to a portion of the population. At first, I propose to 
think of cryptocurrency as media. Below, I present a genealogy of the 
ideologies that animated the creation of Bitcoin, in order to 
demonstrate the libertarian values that guided the design of this new 
technology. Finally, I discuss how fintech 3.0 spreads the social logic 
of the indebted man through personal digital devices</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Apocalyptic thinking has a long religious and political 
tradition, but what place does it occupy within the temporal universe of
 contemporary capitalism? In this essay, we use the figure of the 
eschaton to draw out the loaded and ambiguous character of the future as
 it emerges through the condition of indebtedness. This entails a 
departure from political economy accounts of capitalist futurity, which 
stress the structural logic of financial speculation, in favour of an 
existential account that begins instead with the cosmology of money and 
debt. We argue that finance capital's fixation on the future has 
produced a very specific form of apocalyptic imagination, characteristic
 of financial society and built on a libidinal economy of leverage. 
Rather than offering an ecstatic end to the global process of 
financialization, financial eschatologies bind the contemporary subject 
to debt and indebtedness to the very end: an endless apocalypse, 
premised on the ends of finance itself.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Platform businesses allow for collaboration with 
nontraditional partners and bring together different categories of 
customers, in the financial context savers and investors or lenders and 
borrowers, creating large, scalable networks of users. Their entry into 
finance promises potential benefits to consumers in the form of new 
products, lower prices, wider choice, and enhanced consumer experience. 
At the same time, their new business models and technologies potentially
 threaten the dominant position of traditional financial services 
providers and create challenges for regulators. Platform businesses can 
use their preferential access to customer data to skim off high-quality 
loans, leaving only low-quality customers for other lenders. Their 
ability to offer complementary nonfinancial services that cannot be 
supplied by FinTech start-ups and banks can make it difficult or 
unattractive for customers to switch to alternative providers. This 
danger is especially acute when BigTech firms have monopoly power in 
other markets that complement financial services.</td>

function. This research hypothesizes that tokenizing the asset increases
 its price by improving the democracy of the market and its liquidity, 
and eventually results in a price bubble, although it is not clear how 
long it will last. Furthermore, this impact is hypothesized to be 
greater on the previously lesser-known assets, because of the dominant 
investor sentiment and valuation subjectivity. Specifically, the art 
market is designated as a research context because blockchain 
applications has been expected to innovate the market by resolving its 
problems of centralization, inefficiency, and information asymmetry.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper contributes to emerging discussions of blockchain 
governance through an analysis of dispute resolution platforms that 
reimagine justice. We focus specifically on Kleros, a blockchain-enabled
 dispute resolution platform, that promises to secure, authenticate, and
 democratize access to justice for the twenty-first century. We advance 
the concept of cryptocourts whereby jurors, incentivized by accumulating
 cryptocurrency, rapidly mobilize using principles of on-demand 
crowdsourcing to resolve disputes. We critique the broader social 
imaginaries that cryptocourts such as Kleros will result in a more open,
 trustworthy, transparent, and democratic systems of justice. These 
platforms instead pose important questions concerning their potential 
impact on civil dispute resolution practices by embedding it within an 
economy of cryptocurrency speculation. This ostensibly results in a 
legal infrastructure founded on principles of financial acquisition that
 positions jurors as economic agents seeking to profit from disputes, 
and courts as computational systems that merely authenticate and secure 
the distribution of evidence and verdicts.</td>

						<td>The official launch of the Libra project in 2019, and the 
subsequent troubles experienced by the project, stimulated a vigorous 
debate, from different perspectives, on the pros and cons of a private 
currency with global ambitions. This paper describes the main

partial taxonomy of the increasingly crowded field of so-called 'digital
 currencies'. In the light of the distinguishing features and risks of 
such an ambitious project, the paper also aims to assess the potential 
impact on a crucial issue of the present international monetary system: 
the power to create money.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This essay offers conceptual development for thinking diverse 
economies in terms of their relationship to antagonism. Rather than 
seeing antagonism as unhelpfully fueling capitalocentric thinking, the 
essay argues that antagonism can usefully recognize and engage with 
problematic forms of power and domination. Building on calls for a 
closer engagement of community-economies thinking with wider 
anticapitalist praxis, the essay explores how social and solidarity 
economy (SSE) practices sometimes reproduce, sometimes challenge, and 
sometimes build alternatives to forms of power that attempt to shape, 
obstruct, and obliterate attempts to create better worlds. The essay 
develops conceptualizations of social enterprise, the social economy, 
and solidarity economies before offering the novel concept of the 
antagonistic economy, arguably a site from which angry opposition to 
constraining power relations can generate a more productive politics of 
possibility. The conception of the antagonistic economy is developed by 
discussion of taking back labor through recovered factories and land 
through community land trusts.</td>

aggregate and compositional effects on U.S. commercial banking sector

how these balance sheet changes could affect monetary policy 
implementation, the demand for central bank reserves, and the market for

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The burgeoning digital-platforms literature across multiple 
business disciplines has primarily characterized the platform as a 
market or network. Although the organizing role of platform owners is 
well recognized, the literature lacks a coherent approach to 
understanding organizational governance in the platform context. Drawing
 on classic organizational governance theories, this paper views digital
 platforms as a distinct organizational form where the mechanisms of 
incentive and control routinely take center stage. We systematically 
review research on digital platforms, categorize specific governance 
mechanisms related to incentive and control, and map a multitude of 
idiosyncratic design features studied in prior research onto these 
mechanisms. We further develop an integrative framework to synthesize 
the review and to offer novel insights into the interrelations among 
three building blocks: value, governance, and design. Using this 
framework as a guide, we discuss specific directions for future research
 and offer a number of illustrative questions to help advance our 
knowledge about digital platforms' governance mechanisms and design 
features.</td>

						<td>This paper is placed in the context of a growing number of 
social and political critiques of blockchain technologies. We focus on 
the supposed potential of blockchain technologies to transform political
 institutions that are central to contemporary human societies, such as 
money, property rights regimes, and systems of democratic governance. 
Our aim is to examine the way blockchain technologies canbring about - 
and justify - new models of governance. To do so, we draw on the 
philosophical works of Hobbes, Rousseau, and Rawls, analyzing blockchain
 governance in terms of contrasting social contract theories. We begin 
by comparing the justifications of blockchain governance offered by 
members of the blockchain developers' community with the justifications 
of governance presented within social contract theories. We then examine
 the extent to which the model of governance offered by blockchain 
technologies reflects key governance themes and assumptions located 
within social contract theories, focusing on the notions of sovereignty,
 the initial situation, decentralization and distributive justice.</td>

						<td>Of the phenomena in the field of media technologies that have 
conquered imaginations and funding buckets recently, blockchain 
technologies, next to artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
might be considered the most striking example. The blockchain 
constitutes a protocological internet layer for values that corresponds 
to a continuing monetization pressure and ongoing expansion of 
identification strategies. Notwithstanding these trajectories, behind 
this prospective killer application resides first of all a sovereign 
chronological regime that has the capacities to prove and modulate the 
existence, identity and administration of data, assets, goods and 
services from a distance on granular scales.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Along with the emerging use of cryptocurrency systems, new 
forms of decentralised blockchain-based networks are envisioned and 
being developed. These networks are extending the scope of using 
blockchain technology beyond solely financial contexts into novel fields
 of application. Investigating the ways in which such networks are 
implemented in societies and how they are governed requires 
understanding the underlying technical structures, social practices and 
forms of governance within such networks. Investigating these internal 
aspects of decentralised blockchain-based networks is the main focus of 
this thesis. Drawing on accounts in the field of science and technology 
studies (STS), this thesis will elaborate on decentralised 
cryptocurrency systems as being constituted by technical aspects of 
their infrastructure, as well as the social relations within them. 
Building upon an understanding of the socio-technical structure of such 
systems, the influence of their decentralised character on the 
constitution of user identities is presented. It will be investigated 
how the socio-technical character and decentralised structure of 
cryptocurrency systems leads to new forms of governance within them and,
 correspondingly, in the decentralised blockchain-based networks they 
are a part of. Two illustrative cases of decentralised blockchain-based 
networks in electricity markets and the forms of governance within them 
will be examined.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Research by political economists typically highlights 
policymakers, regulators, economists and consultants as the makers of 
economies. This paper foregrounds a different actor entirely, what I 
call the ‘hacker-engineer' as an important protagonist in the making of 
decentralised digital network economies that are forged through the 
emerging field of ‘cryptoeconomics' and blockchain and other distributed
 ledger technologies. Responding to critical literature stating that 
blockchain and ‘cryptoeconomics' merely extend neoliberal processes of 
economisation, the paper recovers the neglected hacker culture of 
cypherpunk and histories of peer-to-peer decentralised networks in order
 to foreground concerns that depart from the continuation of economics 
and economies as usual. Hacker-engineers are dedicated to 
decentralisation as a ‘disruptive' response to network control and 
surveillance, and share a pragmatist sensibility that seeks to make 
decentralised networks ‘work' in order to provide informational security
 and privacy. While further broadening the range of agents that provide 
the focus for political economy research into the production of 
economies, the paper also draws attention to the technical decisions of 
hacker-engineers that attempt to reconfigure the material 
infrastructures of digital economies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The emergence of cryptocurrencies has been one of the most 
notable monetary phenomenon of the last decade. Many academics and 
analysts have found a clear precedent to this event in Friedrich Hayek's
 latest monetary work, Denationalization of money. The aim of this 
article is to analyze what we can learn about cryptocurrencies by 
re-reading this book. As will be proven, Hayek would surely have 
rejected the idea that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies with similar 
characteristics could be accepted as money in the market. Furthermore, 
this paper will prove that a very close connection between Stablecoins 
and private money exists, following the Austrian economist's predictions
 in a context of monetary competition.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Emerging technologies, such as AI systems, distributed 
ledgers, but also private e-commerce and telecommunication platforms 
have permeated every aspect of our social, economic, political 
relations. Various bodies of the state, from education, via law 
enforcement to healthcare also increasingly rely on technical components
 to provide cheap, efficient public services, and supposedly fair, 
transparent, disinterested, accountable public administration. Most of 
these technical components are provided by private parties who designed,
 developed, trained, and maintain the technical components of public 
infrastructures. The rapid, and often unplanned, and uncontrolled 
technologization of public services (as happened, for example in the 
rapid adoption of distance learning and teleconferencing systems during 
the COVID lockdowns) inseparably link the perception of the quality, 
trustworthiness, effectiveness of public services and the public bodies 
which provision them to the successes and failures of their private, 
technological components: if the government's welfare fraud AI system 
fails, it is the confidence in the governments which is ultimately 
hit.In this contribution we explore how the use of potentially 
untrustworthy private technological systems in the public sector may 
affect the trust in government. We argue that citizens' and business' 
trust in government is a valuable asset, which came under assault from 
many dimensions. The increasing reliance on private technical components
 in government is in part a response to protect this trust, but in many 
cases, it opens up new forms of threats and vulnerabilities, because the
 trustworthiness of many of these private technical systems is, at best,
 questionable, particularly where it is deployed in the context of 
public sector trust contexts. We consider a number of policy options to 
protect the trust in government even if some of their technological 
components are fundamentally untrustworthy.</td>

decentralized material infrastructures, while simultaneously pushing 
forward ‘posthuman' values that are expected to become fixated through 
software. Through an analysis of a ‘collection' of metaphors produced by
 ECSA, this paper sheds light on the work performed by specific

some as an alternative to the law. Based on a study of real-life 
blockchain-based decentralised applications (Dapps), this article takes 
blockchain developers at their word and adopts the point of view of 
users: can blockchain live up to its promise and enable them to transact
 with each other without the need for the trust granted by the law? The 
article particularly highlights that users need to be able to ascertain 
that a self-advertised Dapp indeed qualifies as one. Blockchain 
technology may make it possible to do away with trust in third parties, 
but this is not enough. Users also need to trust that an alleged Dapp 
genuinely is one, and blockchain alone cannot provide this. Beyond 
Dapps, it is argued that blockchain needs the complementary role of the 
law to deliver its promises and especially to authenticate blockchain 
"virtues". The EU certification mark is identified as a promising form 
of co-regulation for that purpose.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Organizations are increasingly deploying technologies that 
have the ability to parse through large amounts of data, acquire skills 
and knowledge, and operate autonomously. These technologies diverge from
 prior technologies in their capacity to exercise intentionality over 
protocol development or action selection in the practice of 
organizational routines, thereby affecting organizations in newand 
distinctways. In this article,we categorize four forms of conjoined 
agency between humans and technologies: (1) conjoined agency with 
assisting technologies, (2) conjoined agency with arresting 
technologies, (3) conjoined agency with augmenting technologies, and (4)
 conjoined agencywith automating technologies. We then theorize on the 
different ways in which these forms of conjoined agency impact a 
routine's change at a particular moment in time as well as a routine's 
responsiveness to feedback over time. In doing so, we elaborate on how 
organizations may evolve in varied and diverse ways based on the form(s)
 of conjoined agency they deploy in their organizational design choices.</td>

						<td>Background: Academic literature on blockchains has focused on 
Bitcoin, which is traditionallyassociated with right-wing 
libertarianism. This article looks at Ethereum, an alternative that 
emerged in Canada and is now the second most used blockchain technology 
after Bitcoin. Analysis: Using participatory observation supplemented 
with publicly available material, this article examines the ideologies 
and imaginaries surrounding Ethereum and how they are articulated with 
its technical design.Conclusion and implications: Ethereum's design 
ostensibly widens the ideological spectrum of cryptocurrency while 
“masking” certain currency ideologies still prominent within it. This 
complicates the distinction seen in the literature between blockchain as
 currency and blockchain as media and points to the increasing need to 
study non-currency-based blockchain technologies. Contexte : La 
recherche sur les blockchains s'est surtout attardé à Bitcoin, en 
l'associant aux idéologies libertariennes. Cet article aborde Ethereum, 
la technologie de blockchain la plus utilisée après Bitcoin.Analyse : 
Basé sur l'observation participante et du matériel publiquement 
accessible, l'article analyse les idéologies et imaginaires entourant 
Ethereum et leur articulation avec son design technique.Conclusion et 
implications : Ethereum élargit le spectre idéologique des blockchains 
tout en «masquant» certaines idéologies monétaires toujours 
proéminentes. Cela complique la distinction énoncée dans la littérature 
entre blockchains comme monnaie et blockchains comme média, etc.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Recent work on algorithmic bias has shown that understanding 
the values embedded in technology design processes is important for 
avoiding social harm. This paper explores the attitudes construed in 
whitepapers of blockchain technology start-ups. Blockchain technology is
 a relatively new phenomenon that has informed discourses about the 
future of governance and economics in relation to the internet. This 
study aims to understand the values discursively construed in the 
whitepapers of four blockchain start-ups: Steemit, Creativechain, 
Democracy Earth, and Bitnation. It adopts a corpus linguistics approach,
 and uses the Appraisal framework (Martin, J. R., and P. R. R. White. 
2005. The Language of Evaluation: Appraisal in English. New York: 
Palgrave Macmillan) to analyse the evaluative meanings expressed in the 
whitepaper dataset. This analysis reveals that the blockchain start-ups 
manifest shared values around the concepts of decentralisation, trust in
 algorithms, and trust in individuals over institutions. The start-ups 
enact different political orientations, expressing ideals related to the
 digital commons, cyber-libertarianism, and capitalism. The corpus-based
 linguistic analysis used in this study offers a method that may be 
applicable to other areas of technology discourse where whitepapers and 
design documents tend to embed covert political and ideological 
positions.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Cryptocurrencies are expected to have a significant impact on 
banking, finance, and monetary systems. Due to the uncertainty as to the
 possible future trajectories of the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem, 
governments have taken a relatively hands-off approach to regulating 
such currencies. This approach may be justified within the theoretical 
information-economics framework of this paper, which draws parallels 
between the information economics of money and quasi-money creation 
within the current central banking, commercial banking, and shadow 
banking systems with that of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In 
particular, drawing lessons from the literature on the role of 
information in creating 'safe assets', in this paper the authors find 
that by building on symmetric (common) knowledge as to the inner 
workings of the Bitcoin Blockchain-though in a different way-BTC 
possesses a degree of endogenous information insensitivity typical of 
safe assets. This endogenous information insensitivity could support 
BTC's promise of maturing into a viable store of value and a niche 
medium of exchange. This finding should not be overlooked in the policy 
discussions for potential future regulatory interventions in the 
cryptocurrency ecosystem.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This dissertation provides an analysis of the ideological 
component behind the crypto-anarchist enthusiasm for the highly topical 
emerging technology of distributed ledger technology, commonly known as 
‘blockchain'. Philosophy of technology scholars have drawn attention to 
the fact that technologies can possess political properties and serve to
 reinforce or challenge power structures. Public blockchains have an 
unquestionable social and political character due to their capacity to 
facilitate the emergence of cryptographic, decentralized and reliable 
peer-to-peer networks. The exponential adoption of this disruptive 
technology, which is poised to cause transformational changes across 
socio-technical systems and organizational structures, means that both 
its political properties and the ideological forces behind its 
development as a political technology must be recognized. Accordingly, 
this dissertation engages with some of the most ideologically-driven 
projects aiming to tap into blockchain's political and economic 
potential, namely those of Bitcoin, FairCoin, Democracy Earth and 
Bitnation. These projects exemplify what is posited as the main 
ideological cleavage within crypto-anarchism, which revolves around the 
privileged agent and vision that should be empowered and trusted to 
capture the decentralizing potential offered by blockchain technology. 
The paper offers an original contribution by conceptualizing the 
cleavage as separating; ‘crypto-libertarians', whose neo-Hobbesian 
individualistic vision sees the invisible hand of the free market as the
 privileged agent driving a trustless technology; and 
‘crypto-commonists', whose collectivist vision regards blockchain as a 
trust-enabling technology that should be used to facilitate 
collaborative economic paradigms and participatory forms of e-democracy.
 The dissertation concludes that while both strands of blockchain 
enthusiasts have a shared interest in promoting personal privacy, 
radical transparency, and eroding the authority of nation-states, their 
diametrically opposed views on human nature and socio-economic 
organization seem presently irreconcilable. The research undertaken for 
this paper has covered a substantial breadth of the existing academic 
material concerning the philosophy and politics of blockchain 
technology, consulting books, journals, white papers and online 
articles. This dissertation contributes with an ideological 
conceptualization to the fields of techno-politics and blockch \ldots

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Legal standardization traditionally played an important role 
in contractual relations. With technological and commercial development 
and expansion of trade from the individual and collective levels to 
internationalization, it became necessary to create a set of standards 
to keep pace with this development and facilitate the contractual 
process. Although smart contracts are considered a leap in the 
contractual relationship, it cannot be overlooked that these contracts 
share many characteristics with traditional contracts. To gain a greater
 position in the global market, smart contracts also need to be well 
functioning and efficient. In this context, the article tackles the 
phenomenon of legal standardization and identifies the main weaknesses 
of smart contracts—to answer two crucial questions: how can these 
contracts be smarter, and how should we employ standardization to ensure
 their efficiency?</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The authors of this article are engaged in anthropological 
research on the links between the growing interest in privacy and data 
security as a technical field and how notions of trust, security and 
accountability are practised in and beyond technical fields of 
cryptography, specifically a field called multi-party computation (MPC).
 They pursue the relationship between trust in different forms of 
cryptography – academic and activist – and notions of trust as they are 
articulated in relation to data security and the protection of citizens'
 data. There is a tension between the concerns raised in public debates 
about data security and the promises of emerging cryptographic 
protocols. In political speeches and public debates, citizens' trust 
that governments and tech companies will protect their data is framed as
 important and essential. In the environments of emerging cryptographic 
technologies, such as blockchains, bitcoin and MPC, a promise to provide
 ‘trustless trust' and abandon the need for trusted intermediaries, 
authorities and institutions is articulated.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper elaborates on the interactions between digital 
technologies and financial practices and how they contribute to the 
ongoing process of financialization. We focus on the circumstances of 
blockchain-based token offerings and their contribution to reshaping 
existing systems of investment in startups. We show how future clients 
become investors via the initial coin offering (ICO) process. The paper 
is based on interviews with blockchain and industry practitioners during
 2018 and 2019 and focuses on an in-depth case study of a specific ICO 
in early 2018. We suggest a framework consisting of catalysts, cracks 
and voids to analyze the financialization process and to inform theories
 of how financialization advances through the new spaces afforded by 
socially constructed technologies upon which entrepreneurs capitalize. 
With this framework we provide a better understanding of the mechanics 
behind financialization, particularly the ways in which business 
processes, and larger social relations such as the role of investors and
 clients, are reimagined and reworked.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article interrogates the assumed promises and perils of 
climate cryptogovernance or deployment of cryptographic technology 
(i.e., blockchain) within climate governance. We distill how climate 
cryptogovernance is being discussed by influential climate policy 
actors, and the implications for reinforcing or challenging how climate 
governance currently occurs. Specifically, through discourse analysis, 
we explore how blockchain technology is presented in the communications 
of international organisations and multistakeholder initiatives in the 
climate policy space. We identify a dominant storyline being advanced 
that views blockchain as an enabler of ambitious climate action, through
 its potential to enhance the reliability, transparency, accountability,
 and democratic quality of climate governance. We critically interrogate
 each of these component elements of the dominant storyline, arguing 
that, taken as a whole, they tend to privilege a technocratic, 
market-oriented approach to climate governance. We conclude by 
reflecting on whether this risks reinforcing a problematic 
‘post-political' turn in environmental governance in the future.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Sociotechnical imaginaries are futures that people envision 
might be possible and desirable. They have a real impact on how systems 
are designed and what values they have embedded in their design. This 
article examines imaginaries about autonomous systems, decentralized 
systems, and decentralized autonomous systems. Through a discussion of 
the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these 
imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative
 research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are 
related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work.
 I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) 
autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, 
and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting
 framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology:
 these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from 
control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous 
systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and 
governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the 
concept of imaginaries in participatory design.</td>

						<td>We examine the relationship between investor attention, and 
measures of uncertainty, with the market dynamics of Bitcoin and other 
cryptocurrencies. We find that increases in investor attention are 
associated with higher returns, more volatility, and greater illiquidity
 in cryptocurrency markets. In contrast, cryptocurrency uncertainty 
(UCRY) and financial market uncertainty (VIX) are also positively 
related to volatility and illiquidity but have a negative 
contemporaneous relationship with returns. The identified relationships 
are accentuated during the COVID-pandemic, and are robust to different 
measures of investor attention, volatility, and illiquidity. Our results
 suggest that monitoring investor attention could assist both investors 
and policymakers.</td>

						<td>Based on daily data about Bitcoin and six other major 
financial assets (stocks, commodity futures (commodities), gold, foreign
 exchange (FX), monetary assets, and bonds) in China from 2013 to 2017, 
we use a VAR-GARCH-BEKK model to investigate mean and volatility 
spillover effects between Bitcoin and other major assets and explore 
whether Bitcoin can be used either as a hedging asset or a safe haven. 
Our empirical results show that (i) only the monetary market, i.e., the 
Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIIBOR) has a mean spillover effect on
 Bitcoin and (ii) gold, monetary, and bond markets have volatility 
spillover effects on Bitcoin, while Bitcoin has a volatility spillover 
effect only on the gold market. We further find that Bitcoin can be 
hedged against stocks, bonds and SHIBOR and is a safe haven when extreme
 price changes occur in the monetary market. Our findings provide useful
 information for investors and portfolio risk managers who have invested
 or hedged with Bitcoin.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain technology has enabled so-called smart contracts 
between different parties on a decentralized network. These 
self-enforceable and self-executable computerized contracts could 
initiate a fundamental paradigm shift in the understanding and 
functioning of our legal practices. Opportunities for their application 
are increasingly understood, and numerous tests of feasibility have been
 completed. However, only very few use cases have yet been implemented 
at scale. This article—as the first of its kind—comprehensively analyzes
 the underlying challenges and locates a key reason for the slow 
adoption in the discrepancy between legal requirements and IT 
capabilities. Our work combines a wide range of academic sources and 
interviews with 30 domain experts from IT, the legal domain and private 
industry. First, we establish that smart contracts still fall within the
 boundaries of the general legal framework. We then systematically 
dissect current shortcomings of smart contracts on three distinct 
levels, namely, (1) how smart contracts are likely to cause conflicts 
with existing laws, (2) how smart contracts are intrinsically limited on
 an individual contract level and (3) how they are impeded by their 
current technical design. Across those levels, we dissect 20 distinct 
issues concerning the current implementation of smart contracts for 
which we derive potential remedies. We further outline implications for 
policy-makers as well as IT management, and examine how information 
systems research can play an important role in advancing smart 
contracts. Finally, we show how managerial and organizational issues 
might represent an ongoing challenge for the widespread adoption of 
smart contracts.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Similar to mobile operating systems, public blockchain 
infrastructures, such as Ethereum, represent a platform for the 
development of software applications. Since 2020, we observe the 
emergence of a rapidly evolving ecosystem of blockchain-based 
applications called Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which aspires to 
challenge traditional finance and associated business models. To explore
 the economic structures that constitute DeFi, we follow an 
interdisciplinary approach, supplementing information systems (IS) 
research with strategic management literature. We apply the theoretical 
lens of strategic groups to identify platform-specific dimensions and 
conceptualize DeFi as a hierarchical structured platform economy 
consisting of four strategic groups, namely 1) Token Management 
Applications, 2) Protocol Platforms, 3) Aggregation Platforms, and 4) 
Decentralized Financial Services Solutions. Further, we give a market 
overview of DeFi applications and discover archetypal attributes of the 
respective groups. Lastly, we present an integrated framework for the 
analysis of software-based platform ecosystems and derive areas for 
future research.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The biggest frontier of mechanization of the past 10 years has
 been the automation, broadly speaking, of interpretation. This includes
 recognition (for example, image recognition technologies used by 
security services), translation (Google Translate), searching for 
information (search engines), understanding (‘predictive algorithms' 
that learn what books or movies you will like or what kind of propaganda
 will appeal to you, as used by Amazon, Netflix, or the Donald Trump 
campaign), trust (blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin), and 
negotiation (‘smart contracts' as pioneered by firms such as Ethereum). 
This article explores how these technologies benefit business and why 
they have come to prominence now, the ways they degrade and exhaust the 
work of both humans and nonhumans, the parallels with earlier uses of 
machines to discipline and extract value from labour, and the 
implications for social movement strategy. The article also suggests 
some directions for research.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The use of new information and communication technologies both
 inside the courts and in private online dispute resolution services is 
quickly changing everyday conflict management. However, the implications
 of the increasingly disruptive role of technology in dispute resolution
 remain largely undiscussed. In this book, assistant professor of law 
and digitalisation Riikka Koulu examines the multifaceted phenomenon of 
dispute resolution technology, focusing specifically on private 
enforcement, which modern technology enables on an unforeseen scale. The
 increase in private enforcement confounds legal structures and 
challenges the nation-state's monopoly on violence. And, in this 
respect, the author argues that the technology-driven privatisation of 
enforcement - from direct enforcement of e-commerce platforms to 
self-executing smart contracts in the blockchain - brings the ethics of 
law's coercive nature out into the open. This development constitutes a 
new, and dangerous, grey area of conflict management, which calls for 
transparency and public debate on the ethical implications of dispute 
resolution technology.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>A new legal field is emerging around blockchain platforms and 
automated transactions. Understanding the relationships between law, 
legal enforcement, and these technological systems has become critical 
for scaling blockchain applications. Because ‘smart contracts' do not 
themselves constitute agreements, the first necessary ‘legal' 
development for transacting with these technologies involves linking 
computational transactions to natural language contracts. Various groups
 have accordingly begun building libraries of machine readable 
transaction modules that correspond to natural language contracting 
elements. In doing so, they are creating the building blocks for ever 
more complex transactions that will ultimately define the entire 
envelope of computational legal conduct in these environments, and 
likely standardise the field. However, also critical to emerging 
blockchain ‘legalities', is the capacity for dispute resolution and 
legal enforcement. Beyond the performance of parties, or the quality of 
goods and services transacted, new mechanisms are also needed to address
 the performance of the computational transaction systems themselves. 
Such mechanisms are necessary to address the reality that smart 
contracts cannot be forced to perform actions beyond the parameters of 
their coding, even by a judicial order. Legal tools, both technological 
and institutional, are thus being developed to ‘soften' the effects of 
self-executing transactions. In this article we treat these developments
 as law-making practices that are constitutive of an emerging legal 
field. Legal engineering exercises of this kind are not novel, and by 
drawing on historic examples from the common law and international 
arbitration, we gain insights into the competitive dynamics likely to be
 shaping legal engagements on the blockchain.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Since the apparition of Bitcoin, decentralization has become 
an ideal praised almost religiously. Indeed, removing the need for a 
central authority prevents many forms of abuse that could be performed 
by a trusted third party, especially when there are no transparency and 
accountability mechanisms in place. Decentralization is however a very 
subtle concept that has limits. In this thesis, we look at the 
decentralization of blockchains at three different levels. First we look
 at the consensus protocol, which is the heart of any decentralized 
system. The Nakamoto protocol, used by Bitcoin, has been shown to induce
 centralization through the shift to mining pools. Additionally, it is 
heavily criticized for the enormous amount of energy it requires. We 
propose a protocol, Fantômette, that incorporates incentives at its core
 and that consumes much less energy than Bitcoin and other proof-of-work
 based cryptocurrencies. If the consensus protocol makes it possible to 
decentralize the enforcement of rules in a cryptocurrency, there is 
still the question of who decides on the rules. Indeed, if a central 
authority is able to determine what those rules are then the fact that 
they are enforced in a decentralized way does not make it a 
decentralized system. We study the governance structure of Bitcoin and 
Ethereum by making measurements of their GitHub repositories and 
providing quantitative ways to compare their level of centralization by 
using appropriate metrics based on centrality measures. Finally, many 
applications are now built on top of blockchains. These can also induce 
or straightforwardly lead to centralization, for example by requiring 
that users register their identities to comply with regulations. We show
 how identities can be registered on blockchains in a decentralized and 
privacy-preserving way.</td>

						<td>The rapid development of digital technologies such as 
blockchain and distributed ledger-based systems holds transformative 
potential for the financial sector. Promising applications include asset
 management as well as peer-to-peer networks for the transparent 
exchange of data and information. International climate finance stands 
to benefit in particular ways from these new opportunities in financial 
technology. Distributed ledger technologies could be leveraged to 
support climate action, for example by facilitating transparent and 
standardized transactions, or by enabling more efficient monitoring and 
accreditation processes. In view of these promising opportunities, we 
focus our inquiry on the case of the Green Climate Fund to explore how 
distributed ledger technologies can be used for innovative climate 
finance. Based on our analysis of different digital system models and 
potential use cases, we then discuss some of the technical and political
 challenges that may arise, for example with regard to standards and 
safeguards, governance processes, country ownership, and further 
capitalization. Our findings show that distributed ledger-based systems 
could benefit the work of the fund in key areas such as 
multi-stakeholder coordination and impact assessment. However, our 
analysis also points to the concrete limitations of technology driven 
solutions. Digital technologies are not a standalone solution to 
persistent resource allocation and governance challenges in 
international climate finance, especially because the design and 
deployment of these digital systems is inherently political.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The launch of Libra, a corporate-controlled supranational 
currency is a bold attempt by a bigtech behemoth to leverage its 
monopoly over digital data and platform networks in order to draw 
low-income and unbanked households into its web of interconnected 
financial services. But in the process, argues the author, it will 
likely exacerbate financial fragility, global imbalances, and the 
already substantial financial subordination of developing countries. 
Even if Facebook's plan to launch a global private digital currency, 
Libra, as soon as next year (in 2020) flounders the announcement is 
still significant as an opening salvo by a US corporate power, globally 
dominant in the field of new technology, to push its disruptive 
potential into the sphere of the international monetary system. The 
announcement of the social network behemoth's entry into the sphere of 
finance has, not surprisingly, triggered both speculation and backlash. 
Writing in the Financial Times blog, FTalphaville, which has excellent, 
if skeptical, analysis of this crypto-currency pretender, Isabella 
Kaminska calls Libra A glorified exchange traded fund which uses 
blockchain buzz words to neutralize the regulatory impact of coming to 
market without a license as well as to veil the disproportionate 
influence of Facebook, in what it hopes will eventually become a global 
digital reserve system. (Kaminska 2019b) The claim is that this currency
 will have all the attributes of the world's best currencies: stability,
 low inflation, wide global acceptance, and fungibility (Libra 2019). 
And the announcement comes at a time when Facebook is plagued by 
accusations of misuse of private data, widespread abuse of its digital 
platform, and blatantly anti-competitive practices, and has been slapped
 with a $5 billion fine by the Federal Trade Commission for data privacy
 violations (Murphy 2019a). Whatever might be the pitfalls of such 
hubris, the launch reflects deeper structural trends in contemporary 
capitalism. Before the full implications of these structural trends can 
be grasped, it is necessary to cut through the buzz and hype surrounding
 the launch of Libra and clarify some of the nuts and bolts of the 
proposed plan.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The globalisation of capitalism has disadvantaged those people
 and places marginal to the capitalist development process. The local 
exchange trading system represents a possible approach to the challenge 
of relocalising social and economic identity. Despite the growing 
importance of local exchange trading systems (LETS) in the UK, 
geographical research into the concept is limited. This paper examines 
the potential of LETS as a response to the hegemonic influence of global
 capitalism. The empirical evidence focuses on the development and 
operation of LETS in Glasgow. The research analyses both successful and 
unsuccessful LETS in the city, examines the prospects for further 
development of LETS in the UK, and considers the potential value of the 
concept particularly for people and places disadvantaged by the 
capitalist market economy. © 1997, Sage Publications. All rights

			<h2>Magical capitalism, gambler subjects: South Korea's bitcoin investment frenzy</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>‘First, it was just tech people. Now, literally everyone is 
interested in bitcoin', said CNN News while reporting on the bitcoin 
mania that haunted South Korean society in the winter of 2017–2018. This
 study takes that speculative frenzy as an entry point for exploring lay
 bitcoin investors' experiences and the ‘magical' features of 
contemporary financial capitalism. It first situates the bitcoin 
investment boom in the contexts of South Korea's post-developmental 
transition and the rise of mass investment culture. Drawing upon 
participant observation of online communities for South Korea's bitcoin 
investors, this study then demonstrates how lay bitcoin investors' daily
 beliefs and practices are distinguished from more traditional economic 
subjectivities–namely, disciplined workers and rational investors. Lay 
bitcoin investors present themselves not simply as calculative investors
 but also as enchanted gamblers who often rely upon magical formulas and
 rituals that express their hopes and despairs in the face of an 
uncertain future. Instead of dismissing their beliefs and rituals as 
‘irrational exuberance', this study argues that their cultural practices
 should be understood as a reflexive response to the ‘magical' 
mechanisms of the financial market based on self-referential valuation 
and self-fulfilling performativity. In examining how the logics of 
uncertainty and magic are returned at the heart of contemporary 
capitalism, this study consequently seeks to situate the lay investors' 
struggles in dealing with the ambiguous future within the broader 
transformation of the human condition during the triumphant rise of 
financial capitalism.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent 
objects like art, collectible, and in-game items. They are traded 
online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encoded within 
smart contracts on a blockchain. Public attention towards NFTs has 
exploded in 2021, when their market has experienced record sales, but 
little is known about the overall structure and evolution of its market.
 Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs
 between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021, obtained primarily from 
Ethereum and WAX blockchains. First, we characterize statistical 
properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions, 
show that traders typically specialize on NFTs associated with similar 
objects and form tight clusters with other traders that exchange the 
same kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs 
according to their visual features and show that collections contain 
visually homogeneous objects. Finally, we investigate the predictability
 of NFT sales using simple machine learning algorithms and find that 
sale history and, secondarily, visual features are good predictors for 
price. We anticipate that these findings will stimulate further research
 on NFT production, adoption, and trading in different contexts.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article considers the impact of digital technologies on 
the interpersonal and institutional logics of trust production. It 
introduces the new theoretical concept of technology-mediated trust to 
analyze the role of complex techno-social assemblages in trust 
production and distrust management. The first part of the article argues
 that globalization and digitalization have unleashed a crisis of trust,
 as traditional institutional and interpersonal logics are not attuned 
to deal with the risks introduced by the prevalence of digital 
technologies. In the second part, the article describes how digital 
intermediation has transformed the traditional logics of interpersonal 
and institutional trust formation and created new trust-mediating 
services. Finally, the article asks as follows: why should we trust 
these technological trust mediators? The conclusion is that at best, it 
is impossible to establish the trustworthiness of trust mediators, and 
that at worst, we have no reason to trust them.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Subscribing to a techno-utopian discourse replacing 
institutions and experts with “trust in code,” digital alternative 
currency Bitcoin is pitched as a “math-based money” governed by 
incorruptible code rather than human regulators. In three cases, which 
occurred between 2013 and 2015, we examine this system at moments of 
breakdown. In contrast to the discourse, we find that power is 
concentrated to critical sites and individuals who manage the system 
through ad hoc negotiations, and who users must therefore implicitly 
trust—a contrast we call Bitcoin's “promissory gap.” But even in the 
face of such contradictions between premise and reality, the discourse 
is maintained. We identify four authorizing strategies used in this 
work: conflating people with devices, assuming actors conform to notions
 of economic rationality, appealing to technical expertise, and 
explaining contradictions as temporary bugs. We contend that these 
strategies are mobilized widely to legitimize a variety of applications 
of algorithmic regulation and peer production projects.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Governance in online communities is an increasingly 
high-stakes challenge, and yet many basic features of offline governance
 legacies-juries, political parties, term limits, and formal debates, to
 name a few-are not in the feature-sets of the software most community 
platforms use. Drawing on the paradigm of Institutional Analysis and 
Development, this paper proposes a strategy for addressing this lapse by
 specifying basic features of a generalizable paradigm for online 
governance called Modular Politics. Whereas classical governance 
typologies tend to present a choice among wholesale ideologies, such as 
democracy or oligarchy, Modular Politics would enable platform operators
 and their users to build bottom-up governance processes from 
computational components that are modular and composable, highly 
versatile in their expressiveness, portable from one context to another,
 and interoperable across platforms. This kind of approach could 
implement pre-digital governance systems as well as accelerate 
innovation in uniquely digital techniques. As diverse communities share 
and connect their components and data, governance could occur through a 
ubiquitous network layer. To that end, this paper proposes the 
development of an open standard for networked governance.</td>

			<h2>Money after Blockchain: Gold, Decentralised Politics and the New Libertarianism</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain technologies are central to what has been described
 as a new ‘smart social contract'. With blockchain, individual 
cryptographic identity becomes the basis for new forms of money and for a
 whole suite of restructured social, political and financial 
transactions. But what do these developments signal for feminist 
engagements with the money economy? The transparency and pseudonymity 
that the blockchain provides has been welcomed as a ‘feminist weapon'. 
But the decentralised technology also legitimises many longstanding 
assumptions of libertarianism, especially competitive individualism, 
naturalised social inequality and the stability of value associated with
 the gold standard. Drawing on popular culture texts, Goldfinger and The
 Mandibles, this article considers this history, examining the gendered,
 racialised and sexualised discursive practices that attend 
representations of gold along with the ‘metallism' surrounding 
blockchain-based cryptocurrencies in the contemporary conjuncture. By 
claiming to represent non-negotiable certainty derived from 
technology/nature rather than social convention, the fantasy of 
fundamental value returns, together with related associations of 
essentialism and authenticity, but anchored in this new context in the 
technocratic authoritarianism of FinTech. This is part of the background
 for the ‘new libertarianism' whose ascendency now overshadows the 
neoliberalism that has been the focus of critical attention for some 
decades.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Complementary currencies are usually seen as a by-product of 
collective movements for social change or as an institutional tool for 
local development: they are an outcome of collective action, not the 
origin of collective mobilisation. Empirical research on the Sardex 
complementary currency, though, suggests that money may support the 
emergence of collective action. Traditional economic theory considers 
any collective benefits provided by the economic system as the secondary
 effects of individual entrepreneurs seeking to maximise their profits. 
Entrepreneurs belonging to the Sardex network, though, do associate the 
use of the Sardex currency with direct collective benefits. This means 
they consider their business activities to be a form of collective 
action for promoting the com-mon good of Sardinia's socio-economic 
development. Using the Sardex currency sets this collective action in 
motion: some Sardex members also work to expand the Sardex network 
without any expectation of economic gain.</td>

						<td>This Comment explores the lawfulness of using bitcoin, a

ability of the federal government to bar transactions between two 
willing parties. While there are no cases yet challenging the ability of
 parties in the United States to make transactions using bitcoins, there
 are policymakers who have denounced the use of bitcoin. This has led to
 the question of whether the federal government has the ability under 
current federal law to prohibit the use of bitcoins between willing 
parties. This Comment will show that the federal government has no basis
 to stop bitcoin users who engage in traditional consumer purchases and 
transfers. This Comment further argues that the federal government 
should refrain from passing any laws or regulations limiting the use of 
bitcoins. Should any claim arise, this Comment argues that there is a 
perfectly acceptable model with which to analogize bitcoin use: 
community currencies.</td>

						<td>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a decentralized proof of

 technology. This paper presents the first systematic study of the 
interactions occurring in a number of NFT ecosystems. We illustrate how 
to retrieve transaction data available on the blockchain and structure 
it as a graph-based model. Thanks to this methodology, we are able to 
study for the first time the topological structure of NFT networks and 
show that their properties (degree distribution and others) are similar 
to those of interaction graphs in social networks. Time-dependent 
analysis metrics, useful to characterize market influencers and 
interactions between different wallets, are also introduced. Based on 
those, we identify across a number of NFT networks the widespread 
presence of both investors accumulating NFTs and individuals who make 
large profits.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In less than a decade Bitcoin and the technology of blockchain
 – a cryptographically-secured, algorithmically-regulated, 
distributed-ledger – emerged as the enfant terrible of the global 
economy. Ironically, as cryptocurrencies reached collective valuations 
of hundreds of billions of dollars the Bitcoin project failed in its 
original purpose as an alternative currency governed by code rather than
 trust. Not only has Bitcoin not become a popular means of global 
peer-to-peer transactions but the much vaulted purity of algorithmic 
governance is heavily entangled in social relations. This article 
reviews blockchain's computer architectures, its connections to 
materiality and space and the complexity of its established practices. 
This analysis shows that rather than occupying an algorithmic place 
apart, blockchain contains multiple and conflicting agencies and is 
messily embedded in the code/space of materiality. Nevertheless the 
faith in the superiority of algorithmic governance has injected a 
powerful discourse in economies that has proven more important and 
disruptive than the actual practices of Bitcoin or blockchain.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this paper, we analyze the connectedness between returns 
for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other financial assets (equities, 
bonds, currencies, gold, oil, Ethereum) during the period from January 
2018 to June 2021. By using the Time-Varying Parameter Vector 
Autoregressions (TVP-VAR) approach, we show that the overall 
connectedness between the returns for financial assets increased during 
the COVID-19 period. Our static analysis shows that the behavior of the 
majority of NFT returns is attributable to endogenous shocks and only a 
small portion of this variation resulted from the impact of innovation 
in other assets. The results suggest that NFTs are mainly independent of
 shocks from common assets classes and even from their close relation, 
Ethereum. The dynamic analysis across time reveals that during normal 
times, NFTs act as transmitters of systemic risk to some degree, but 
during stressful times, their role shifts, and they act as absorbers of 
risk spillovers. This suggests that NFTs may have diversification 
benefits during turbulent times, as apparent during the COVID-19 crisis,
 and especially around the great March 2020 market plunge.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The extraordinary current craze around NFTs reflects their 
perceived value as a technological development that can bring greater 
certainty to questions of ownership and authenticity in fields like art 
and other collectibles. This is, among other things, the promise of 
crime prevention through technology, as ownership and authenticity are 
in the art world closely tied to criminal legal matters like theft, 
handling stolen goods and fraud. The crime prevention promise looks to 
fall flat though, as the technology seems to be less capable of 
delivering these benefits than has been assumed by its promoters. Much 
of the attraction of NFTs is therefore not actually based on effective 
crime prevention, but rather on hype. This paper explores the hype, and 
its relationship to the crime prevention promise of NFTs, through the 
lens of ‘the social lives of things'. We argue that as well as social 
lives, things have criminal lives. Analysis sensitive to the criminal 
lives of things finds an NFT trading scene heated by emotion: 
excitement, attraction, temptation, speculative euphoria and 
acquisitive, possessive sentiment. This creates a sense of object agency
 more active than the cold traditional vision of material structure 
presented in standard criminological treatments of things-in-the-world 
as passive opportunity structures. The hyped NFT market trades in 
affecting objects that create crime in emotional as well as structural 
ways. We therefore arrive at a conclusion opposite to starting 
assumptions: far from preventing crime, NFTs are making it.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), transferrable and 
unique digital assets on public blockchains, has received widespread 
attention and experienced strong growth since early 2021. This study 
provides an introduction to NFTs and explores the 14 largest submarkets 
using data from the Ethereum blockchain between June 2017 and May 2021. 
The analyses rely on (a) the number of NFT sales, (b) the dollar volume 
of NFT trades and (c) the number of unique blockchain wallets that 
traded NFTs. Based on the number of transactions and wallets, the 
Ethereum-based NFT market peaked at the end of 2017 due to the success 
of the CryptoKitties project. As of 2021, fewer transactions occur but 
the traded value is much higher. We find that NFT submarkets are 
cointegrated and feature various causal short-run connections between 
them. The success or adoption of younger NFT projects is influenced by 
that of more established markets. At the same time, the success of newer
 markets has an impact on the more established projects. The results 
contribute to the overall understanding of the NFT phenomenon and 
suggest that NFT markets are immature or even inefficient.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This study examines the risk and return characteristics of the
 NFT-based startups listed on the cryptocurrency exchange. Our 
investigation is motivated by the recent surge in the NFT activity on 
the part of creators, investors, and traders. We begin by proposing 
novel classification of the existing NFTs that range from NFT 
blockchains through NFT metaverse to NFT DeFi. Next, we establish that 
NFTs: 1) earn 130% on the first-listing-day; 2) yield an average 
investment multiple of 40 (roughly 4,000%) over long-term, which is four
 times higher than bitcoin during the same period; 3) deliver positive 
and significant alpha and exhibit above-average beta. We also show that 
the NFT segment of the cryptocurrency market leads market recovery 
following the mid-2021 crash and generate a return of close to 350%. In 
the final analysis of the paper, we find that NFT infrastructure 
integrated within the existing blockchains increase market valuations of
 these networks. 1This</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The first high-profile decentralized autonomous organization 
formed in 2016. Called "TheDAO," it used smart contracts on a 
bitcoin-style blockchain to allow strangers to come together online to 
vote on and invest in venture capital proposals. Newspapers raved about 
the $160 million it quickly raised, even though it purported to have no 
central human authority, including no managers , executives, or board of
 directors. Technologists have grand plans for smart contracts and 
autonomous organizations. Rather than staying at traditional hotels with
 elaborate human staff, we may pay for hotel rooms using bitcoin (or 
another cryptocurrency) which will automatically unlock the room door. 
If the toilet breaks, the room itself will contract with a plumber to 
fix it. Similarly, a smart contract may allow us to hire a self-driving 
car. The car will not only drive passengers around but arrange for its 
own routine maintenance. TheDAO itself, however, is now a cautionary 
tale. A bug in its smart contract code was exploited to drain more than 
$50 million in value. Some purists denounced efforts to mitigate the 
problem, arguing that the alleged hacker simply withdrew money in 
accordance with the organization's agreed-upon contractual terms in the 
form of computer code. Since the "code is the contract" in their minds, 
the alleged hacker did nothing wrong. I defend two related claims. 
First, contra the purists, I argue that the code does not reflect the 
entirety of the parties' agreement, and so the "code is the contract" 
slogan does not resolve whether TheDAO exploitation should have</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The invention of Bitcoin in 2008 as a new type of electronic 
cash has arguably been one of the most radical financial innovations in 
the last decade. Recently, developer communities of blockchain 
technologies have started to turn their attention towards the issue of 
governance. The features of blockchain governance raise questions as to 
tensions that might arise between a strictly “on-chain” governance 
system and possible applications of “off-chain” governance. In this 
paper, we approach these questions by reflecting on a long-running 
debate in legal philosophy regarding the construction of a positivist 
legal order. First, we argue that on-chain governance shows striking 
similarities with Kelsen's notion of a positivist legal order, 
characterised by Schmitt as the machine that runs itself. Second, we 
illustrate some of the problems that emerged from the application of 
on-chain governance, with particular reference to a calamity in a 
blockchain-based system called the DAO. Third, we reflect on Schmitt's 
argument that the coalescence of private interests is a vulnerability of
 positivist legal systems, and accordingly posit this as an inherent 
vulnerability of on-chain governance of existing blockchain-based 
systems.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Cryptocurrencies are frequently framed as future-oriented, 
technological innovations that decentralize money, thereby liberating it
 from centralized governance and the political tentacles of the state. 
This is misleading on several counts. First, electronic currencies 
cannot leave the politics of money behind even where they aim to disavow
 it. Instead, we can understand their impact as a political attempt to 
depoliticize money. Second, the dramatic price swings of 
cryptocurrencies challenge their self-fashioning as a new form of money 
and reveal them instead as speculative assets and securities in need of 
regulation. While the preferential tax and regulatory treatment of 
cryptocurrencies hinges on their nominal currency status, it is 
ironically precisely their success as speculative assets that has 
undermined these claims. Finally, far from heralding a radical break 
with the past, electronic currencies serve as a reminder of the 
unresolved global politics of money since the 1970s. To support these 
three interrelated theses this chapter places the rise of 
cryptocurrencies in the historical context of the international politics
 of money between the end of the Bretton Woods system and the response 
to the 2008 Financial Crisis.</td>

						<td>Blockchains are distributed ledger technologies that allow the
 recording of any data structure, including money, property titles, and 
contracts. In this paper, we suggest that Hayekian political economy is 
especially well suited to explain how blockchain emerged, but that 
Elinor Ostrom's approach to commons governance is particularly useful to
 understand why blockchain anarchy is successful. Our central 
conclusions are that the blockchain can be thought of as a spontaneous 
order, as Hayek anticipated, as well as a knowledge commons, as Ostrom's
 studies of self-governance anticipated.</td>

 money. We then show how normative questions about monetary policy find 
new expression in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These questions 
can play a role in addressing not just what money is, but what it should
 be. A guiding theme in our discussion is that progress here requires a 
mixed approach that integrates philosophical tools with the purely 
technical results of disciplines like computer science and economics.</td>

<div><p>If you've spent much time around cryptocurrency people, you've 
probably heard a rant or two about "sound money" and the need to 
"depoliticize money." This is a foundation of blockchainism: the belief 
that money is born separate from states, and states invade on the 
private realm when they "meddle" in the money system.</p>
<p>There are at least two serious problems with this ideology. First, 
it's plain wrong on the historical facts. Money did not emerge from 
barter systems among people. Money was and is a product of state.</p>
<p>But even if you stipulate that money didn't originate among private 
markets there's another serious historical problem with "sound money." 
... It's this: central banks didn't emerge to usurp the private sector's
 control over money. Central banks were created because without them, 
finance was subject to wild, terrifying, ruinous boom/bust cycles. 
What's more, without a central bank, money was subject to naked 
political meddling, which central banks (sometimes) moderated.</p></div>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this study, through the lens of critical realism to power, 
we take a close look into the power dynamics behind the Bitcoin protocol
 in relation to its Cypherpunk philosophical underpinnings. We focus on 
some of its main components that can be seen as constraining structures,
 and we discuss how these structures generate constraining mechanisms 
that restrict users' power to act, further reinforcing other entities” 
power over them. In doing so, we illustrate that the Bitcoin Protocol, 
as it is used today, is in tension with the principles on which it was 
developed. In addition, we show that power, instead of being 
decentralised and distributed to the many, it has merely shifted from 
traditional actors to what can be seen as newcomers or atypical 
regulators. In line with the paradigm of critical realism, we note that 
the identified mechanisms and structures we discuss in this paper, are 
those that we were able to observe through our subjective lens; others 
may exist but may require different contextual conditions to be 
activated and observed.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This essay is an early ethnographic exploration of the Dark 
Web Social Network (DWSN), a social networking site only accessible to 
Web browsers equipped with The Onion Router. The central claim of this 
essay is that the DWSN is an experiment in power/freedom, an attempt to 
simultaneously trace, deploy, and overcome the historical conditions in 
which it finds itself: the generic constraints and affordances of social
 networking as they have been developed over the past decade by Facebook
 and Twitter, and the ideological constraints and affordances of public 
perceptions of the dark web, which hold that the dark web is useful for 
both taboo activities and freedom from state oppression. I trace the 
DWSN's experiment with power/freedom through three practices: 
anonymous/social networking, the banning of child pornography, and the 
productive aspects of techno-elitism. I then use these practices to 
specify particular forms of power/freedom on the DWSN.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Critically engaging with literature on post-politics, 
blockchain and algorithmic governance, and drawing also on knowledge 
gained from undertaking a three-year empirical study, the purpose of 
this article is to better understand the transformative capacity of 
government-led blockchain projects. Analysis of a diversity of empirical
 material, which was guided by a digital ethnography approach, is used 
to support the furthering of the existing debate on the nature of the 
post-political as a condition and/or strategy. Through these theoretical
 and empirical explorations, the article concludes that while the 
post-political represents a contingent political strategy by 
governmental actors, it could potentially impose an algorithmically 
enforced post-political 'condition' for the citizen. It is argued that 
the design, features and mechanisms of government-led projects are 
deliberately and strategically used to delimit a citizens' political 
agency. In order to address this scenario, we argue that there is a need
 not only to analyse and contribute to the algorithmic design of 
blockchain projects (i.e. the affordances and constraints they set), but
 also to the metapolitical narrative underpinning them (i.e. the 
political imaginaries underlying the various government-led projects).</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The rate of adoption of some cryptocurrencies is triggering 
alarm from energy researchers and social scientists concerned about the 
industry's growing environmental and social impacts. In this paper we 
argue that the unsustainable trajectory of some cryptocurrencies 
disproportionately impacts poor and vulnerable communities where 
cryptocurrency producers and other actors take advantage of economic 
instabilities, weak regulations, and access to cheap energy and other 
resources. Globally, over 100 million people hold cryptocurrency, mostly
 as a speculative asset. The digital infrastructure behind the most 
popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin, currently requires as much energy as 
the whole of Thailand, with a carbon footprint exceeding the gold mining
 industry. Should bitcoin's mass adoption continue, an escalating 
climate crisis is inevitable, disproportionately exacerbating social and
 environmental challenges for communities already experiencing multiple 
dimensions of deprivation. In mitigating these impacts, the paper 
considers 4 potential regulatory pathways, including: 1) promoting 
voluntary private-sector commitments to using only renewable energy, 2) 
encouraging a system of voluntary carbon offsetting, 3) using existing 
financial regulations and tax frameworks, and 4) imposing national 
and/or international bans on cryptocurrency ‘mining'. The paper argues 
that effective environmental regulation of cryptocurrencies is urgently 
required, both to reduce the threat of catastrophic climate change, and 
to help the world's poorest towards sustainable development. However, 
regulating cryptocurrency mining in any context is likely to require a 
combination of efforts and is unlikely to result in win-win outcomes for
 all.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>WikiLeaks is among the most controversial institutions of the 
last decade, and this essay contributes to an understanding of WikiLeaks
 by revealing the philosophical paradigm at the foundation of Julian 
Assange's worldview: cypherpunk ethics. The cypherpunk movement emerged 
in the early-1990s, advocating the widespread use of strong cryptography
 as the best means for defending individual privacy and resisting 
authoritarian governments in the digital age. For the cypherpunks, 
censorship and surveillance were the twin evils of the computer age, but
 they viewed encryption as a means to circumvent both. As a cypherpunk, 
Assange advocates for the use of cryptography in the fight for 
individual privacy as well as the fight for global justice. His 
cosmopolitan disposition is informed by his hacker background, antiwar 
principles, and Enlightenment outlook. This essay places Assange's 
philosophical idea in historical context, exploring his views on 
censorship, surveillance, and the right to communicate. It also connects
 his cypherpunk principles to WikiLeaks, showing that the strategy of 
encouraging data leaks from powerful political and economic 
organizations is classic cypherpunk political praxis.</td>

						<td>The literature on law and finance considers that law and 
finance influence each other but are separate spheres that do not 
constitute each other's nature. This paper opposes this conventional 
dichotomy and argues that the current legal structure and legal 
decisions have determined the very nature of shares, including money 
market fund (MMF) shares. Western law has Roman origins and is 
structured by the Roman legal division between property (rights in rem) 
and contract (rights in personam). This paper examines how, in shares — 
including MMF shares — contractual rights have been granted their 
opposite, property rights. This paper argues that this property-ization 
of contractual claims has led to the rise of financial corporate power, 
especially MMFs. The paper then explores how the property-ization of MMF
 shares contributed to generating the financial crisis of 2008, and it 
ends by briefly discussing an MMF reform policy from a legal 
perspective.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper outlines a critical social history of reactionary 
media, political, and information networks—what I refer to generally as 
technopolitics—in the United States and their significance to the 
hostility towards truth and fact that is a central feature of our 
political present. I begin with a critical review of the unique 
right-wing media and political ecosystem that emerged from the alliance 
between neoliberalism and social conservatism in the twentieth-century. 
In the second section, I focus on digitization, Trump, and the 
alt-right, and discuss the historical tethers connecting the latter to 
the cyber-libertarians and white supremacists operating on the early 
internet. Next, I take stock of the history covered in the paper, and 
argue that we can see three general sociopolitical tendencies emerging 
from our current juncture: something like a paleoconservative hardening 
of the Republican Party's base; the degeneration of the core alt-right 
into white supremacist terrorism; and the rise of an “intellectualist” 
reactionary assemblage epitomized by the Intellectual Dark Web (IDW). I 
provide a brief analysis of the IDW and discuss its chief political and 
social significance in the post-Trump, post-alt-right social landscape 
of what Jodi Dean describes as communicative capitalism.</td>

						<td>Blockchain technology has found several innovative 
applications in the electricity industry. However, its potential has 
still to be discovered. This is partly due to the role that regulation 
plays in electricity markets. To be introduced, experimented with, and 
eventually adopted on a commercial scale, blockchain-supported 
innovations need to fit the existing regulatory framework or the rules 
to be reshaped or updated. We focus on energy regulators' possible 
responses to the blockchain-enhanced market operations (both from the 
incumbents and potential newcomers), suggesting a monitoring mechanism 
that can support innovation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain-based smart contracts have triggered polarised 
discussions. They have been applauded as a significant technological 
achievement, but also criticised as a dumb idea. Their application is 
rapidly expanding in the financial sector, public sector, supply chain 
management, and the automobile, real estate, insurance, and health care 
industries. With the growing use of smart contracts and an increasing 
variety of smart contracts applications, the debate over the legal 
implications of this phenomenon has intensified and many legal issues 
related to smart contracts are being examined. Legal scholars have 
highlighted potential legal pitfalls, controversies and 
incompatibilities with existing legal frameworks. Blockchain technology 
and smart contracts have also been fuelling an interest of legislators, 
who have begun to recognise regulatory uncertainties and are making the 
first attempts to introduce legislative solutions to address them. This 
paper aims to highlight the fervour of the scholarly debate surrounding 
smart contracts and contrast it with a rather modest response from the 
legislators thus far. The paper reiterates that smart contracts 
represent the future. Even though they challenge practitioners, 
scholars, and legislators, current legislative initiatives indicate that
 under most legal systems there are no major obstacles for smart 
contracts and to accommodate smart contracts within the existing legal 
frameworks we should expect legal evolution rather than revolution.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper critically examines the intersection and 
interactions between conventional law produced and enforced by national 
legal systems (ie the ‘code of law') and the internal rules of 
blockchain systems, which take the form of executable software code and 
cryptographic algorithms operating across a distributed computing 
network (‘code as law'). In so doing, it seeks to identify whether, and 
to what extent, ‘regulation by blockchain' will successfully avoid 
governance by conventional law. It identifies three different ways in 
which the code of law is likely to interact with code as law, based 
primarily on the intended motives and purposes of those engaged in 
activities in developing, maintaining or undertaking transactions upon 
the network. It argues that these different classes of case are likely 
to generate different kinds of dynamic interaction between the 
blockchain code and conventional legal systems, and critically examines 
the normative foundations of these emerging and anticipated 
interactions.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Much like initial public offerings produce publicly traded 
securities, Initial Coin Offerings (icos) produce crypto tokens 
tradeable on crypto exchanges. Despite an apparent need for investor 
protection the ico and the tokenisation phenomenon have yet to be 
addressed by legislative action on the EU level. The paper studies the 
suitability of the EU regulatory framework to capture tokenised 
financial instruments and utility tokens based on the views of the EU 
supervisory and national competent authorities. It is argued that EU 
regulators shall first ensure legal certainty by defining the scope of 
tokenised financial instruments subject to MiFID. Further, authorisation
 and ongoing requirements shall be adapted to address the risks posed by
 distributed technology and direct global access of investors to crypto 
markets. Finally, there is no immediate need for a bespoke EU-wide 
regime governing utility tokens; fragmentation of the market is a 
positive development providing a testing field for future supranational 
initiatives.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>SEC v. Telegram and SEC v. Kik, both decided in 2020, 
establish some ground-breaking rules about how the federal securities 
laws apply to cryptotransactions. In both cases, the court concluded 
that a large, reputable social media company had conducted a crypto 
offering in violation of federal law. In neither case was fraud or other
 criminal conduct an issue; the sole problem was failure to register the
 sales or comply with an exemption from registration. To find a 
violation, both opinions collapsed a two-phase offering into a single, 
integrated scheme. This approach appears to be an unnecessarily 
overbroad application of the law, protecting neither investors nor 
capital markets. A cost of this approach is that crypto entrepreneurs 
are being forced away from the United States, and American investors are
 denied opportunities to participate in a potentially desirable 
technological revolution. This article examines the rationale employed 
in these two decisions in light of the existing statutory and regulatory
 framework. It also considers recent amendments to federal rules 
defining the “integration doctrine,” which was relied on explicitly in 
the Kik decision. This article suggests how future crypto offerings 
might be structured to avoid the pitfalls created by the Kik and 
Telegram opinions. It advocates a more limited approach than the one 
urged by regulators. Its suggestions depend not on a change in law but 
only a change in understanding what is required in order to conduct a 
compliant crypto offering.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distributed ledger technology, also known as the blockchain, 
is gaining traction globally. Blockchain offers a secure validation 
mechanism and decentralized mass collaboration. Cryptocurrencies make 
use of this technology as a new asset class for investors worldwide. 
Cryptocurrencies are being used by companies to raise capital via 
initial coin offerings (ICOs). The substantial inflow of unregulated 
capital into a transactional and transnational industry has aroused 
interest from not just investors, but also national securities and 
monetary regulatory agencies. In this paper, we review the Security and 
Exchange Commission's initial statements and subsequent pronouncements 
on ICO's to illustrate the potential problems with applying an older 
legal framework to an ever-evolving ecosystem. Recognizing the inability
 of enforcement within existing regulatory frameworks, we discuss the 
importance of regulation of the crypto asset class and internal 
collaboration between government agencies and developers in the 
establishment of an ecosystem that integrates investor protection and 
investments.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In the UK both the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct 
Authority have recently carried out experiments using new digital 
technology for regulatory purposes. The idea is to replace rules written
 in natural legal language with computer code and to use artificial 
intelligence for regulatory purposes. This new way of designing 
regulatory rules is in line with the UK government's vision for the 
country to become a global leader in digital technology. It is also 
reflected in the FCA's business plan. The article reviews the technology
 and the advantages and disadvantages of combining the technology with 
regulatory law. It then informs the discussion from a broader 
perspective. It analyses regulatory technology through criteria 
developed in the mainstream regulatory debate. It contributes to that 
debate by anticipating problems that will arise as the technology 
evolves. In addition, the hope is to assist the government in avoiding 
mistakes that have occurred in the past and creating a better system 
from the start.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is increasingly proposed 
as a powerful tool to address the social and ecological challenges in 
the Global South. DLTs are opening up possible futures, one of which is a
 wave of infrastructure decentralization with common-centric and 
cosmo-local production. Shared logistics and supply chains for a 
circular economy, with collaborative and networked “flow” accounting 
allow the integration of contributive logics as well as the integration 
of social and ecological externalities, including practical knowledge on
 resource use limitations linked to planetary boundaries, as an integral
 part of ecosystems of productive collaboration. Indeed, DLTs remove the
 need for central intermediaries to validate transaction between 
parties, who instead place their trust in the encrypted, 
disintermediated system software. DLTs can be designed as a new 
unencloseable (non-commodifiable) medium of communication, which could 
lead to radically new forms of cooperation, organization, and 
governance. Yet these revolutionary possibilities will not be realized 
unless technologists consciously and strategically design systems 
redistributing sovereignty from elites to the people in financial, 
service, and national infrastructures. This paper concludes with a 
critical examination of the application of DLT in Puerto Rico and how 
DLTs could alter the production and exchange of “value” in service of a 
global popular sovereignty.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The future of energy is complex, with fluctuating renewable 
resources in increasingly distributed systems. It is suggested that 
blockchain technology is a timely innovation with potential to 
facilitate this future. Peer-to-peer (P2P) microgrids can support 
renewable energy as well as economically empower consumers and 
prosumers. However, the rapid development of blockchain and prospects 
for P2P energy networks is coupled with several grey areas in the 
institutional landscape. The purpose of this paper is to holistically 
explore potential challenges of blockchain-based P2P microgrids, and 
propose practical implications for institutional development as well as 
academia. An analytical framework for P2P microgrids is developed based 
on literature review as well as expert interviews. The framework 
incorporates 1) Technological, 2) Economic, 3) Social, 4) Environmental 
and 5) Institutional dimensions. Directions for future work in practical
 and academic contexts are identified. It is suggested that bridging the
 gap from technological to institutional readiness would require the 
incorporation of all dimensions as well as their inter-relatedness. 
Gradual institutional change leveraging community-building and 
regulatory sandbox approaches are proposed as potential pathways in 
incorporating this multi-dimensionality, reducing cross-sectoral silos, 
and facilitating interoperability between current and future systems. By
 offering insight through holistic conceptualization, this paper aims to
 contribute to expanding research in building the pillars of a more 
substantiated institutional arch for blockchain in the energy sector.</td>

						<td>We establish that cryptocurrency returns are driven and can be

Cryptocurrency returns are exposed to cryptocurrency network factors but
 not cryptocurrency production factors. We construct the network factors
 to capture the user adoption of cryptocurrencies and the production 
factors to proxy for the costs of cryptocurrency production. Moreover, 
there is a strong time-series momentum effect, and proxies for investor 
attention strongly forecast future cryptocurrency returns.</td>

						<td>Parmi les technologies majeures qui se sont succédé depuis la 
fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, la blockchain (2009), dont Bitcoin, 
reste encore mal comprise en dehors de ses applications monétaires. Elle
 a pourtant déjà des conséquences importantes dans le champ de la 
création (art, design, jeu vidéo, etc.) à travers le développement, 
depuis 2015, des « Non Fungible Tokens » (NFT) – à savoir la production 
d'un certificat numérique infalsifiable et décentralisé attaché à une 
entité numérique tangible. Contrairement à la pensée des « communs » et à
 la culture du libre, les NFT promettent de créer de la « rareté 
numérique » : sans eux, une fois mis en ligne sur le Web, une image, une
 vidéo, un film ou une musique peuvent être dupliqués et circuler sans 
aucune possibilité de contrôle. Mis en lumière depuis le début de 
l'année 2021 par une multitude de ventes aux sommes record (69 millions 
de dollars pour un NFT de l'artiste Beeple) et par le développement de 
places de marché spécifiques, les NFT soulèvent des enjeux relatifs à la
 valeur, à la circulation et à l'exposition des productions artistiques 
et culturelles.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The law applicable to smart contracts is a neglected topic. At
 times it is even discarded as irrelevant or unnecessary. In fact, many 
authors claim that smart contracts especially when stored and executed 
with the help of blockchain technology make contract law and, in fact, 
the entire legal system obsolete. “Code is law” is the frequently cited 
catchphrase. In the following chapter I will challenge this view and 
argue, first, that smart contracts need contract law just as other, 
traditional contracts, and, second, that the applicable contract law 
can—at least in most cases—be determined with the help of the 
traditional rules of private international law.</td>

blockchains or similar infrastructures that allow the transparent 
execution of predefined processes. Using smart contracts, assets like 
money become programmable, which opens up previously inaccessible 
application potential. To date, smart contracts control billions in 
value. This paper analyzes 468 peer-reviewed articles on the topic of 
smart contracts and their 20,188 references, providing a summary and 
analysis of the current state of research on smart contracts. Using 
exploratory factor analysis for co-citation analysis, we identify six 
different strands of research that concern technical, social, economic 
and legal disciplines: I) technical foundations, development and open 
questions of blockchain networks, II) blockchain and smart contracts for
 the Internet of Things, III) smart contract standardization, 
verification and security, IV) blockchain and smart contracts for the 
disruption of existing processes and industries, V) potentials and 
challenges of smart contracts, and VI) smart contracts and the law. The 
interrelations between these groups are visualized using social network 
analysis. We thus obtain a structured overview of the main strands of 
research concerning smart contracts, their development over time, the 
relevance of smart contract platforms in research, and conceptual 
connections between publications and discourses. The results offer 
researchers and practitioners a substantial basis for their work on

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>If one is to believe the popular press and many “technical 
writings,” blockchains create not only a perfect transactional 
environment but also obviate the need for banks, lawyers and courts. The
 latter will soon be replaced by smart contracts: unbiased and 
infallible computer programs that form, perform and enforce agreements. 
Predictions of future revolutions must, however, be distinguished from 
the harsh reality of the commercial marketplace and the technical 
limitations of blockchains. The fact that a technological solution is 
innovative and elegant need not imply that it is commercially useful or 
legally viable. Apart from attempting a terminological “clean-up” 
surrounding the term smart contract, this paper presents some 
technological and legal constraints on their use. It confronts the 
popular claims concerning their ability to automate transactions and to 
ensure perfect performance. It also examines the possibility of reducing
 contractual relationships to code and the ability to integrate smart 
contracts with the complexities of the real world. A closer analysis 
reveals that smart contracts can hardly be regarded as a semi-mythical 
technology liberating the contracting parties from the shackles of 
traditional legal and financial institutions.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This chapter addresses the myth of decentralized governance of
 public blockchains, arguing that certain people who create, operate, or
 reshape them function much like fiduciaries of those who rely on these 
powerful data structures. Explicating the crucial functions that leading
 software developers perform, the chapter compares the role to Tamar 
Frankel's conception of a fiduciary, and finds much in common, as users 
of these technologies place extreme trust in the leading developers to 
be both competent and loyal (ie, to be free of conflicts of interest). 
The chapter then frames the cost-benefit analysis necessary to evaluate 
whether, on balance, it is a good idea to treat these parties as 
fiduciaries, and outlines key questions needed to flesh out the 
fiduciary categorization. For example, which software developers are 
influential enough to resemble fiduciaries? Are all users of a 
blockchain ‘entrustors' of the fiduciaries who operate the blockchain, 
or only a subset of those who rely on the blockchain? Finally, the 
chapter concludes with reflections on the broader implications of 
treating software developers as fiduciaries, given the existing 
accountability paradigm that largely shields software developers from 
liability for the code they create.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Seven of the ten largest stablecoins are backed by fiat 
assets. The 2016 and 2017 vintages of stablecoins have failure rates of 
100% and 50% respectively. More than one-third of stablecoins have 
failed. Tether has a 39% share of 1.77 trillion USD in 2021Q2 
transactions, and USD Coin 28%. The top three stablecoins have an 
average velocity of 28.3. Tether transacted between 3.8 million unique 
addresses, 63% of the ERC-20 token network. Six of the top ten tokens 
have unconcentrated Herfindahl indices, but Gemini, Pax and Huobi have 
single holders with more than 50% of the supply. The median Tether 
transaction fee is similar to the cost of an ATM transaction, but they 
are three to four times more for Dai and USDC. Fees, which are 
proportional to the price of Ethereum, are rising though. Median fees 
for Tether rose 3,628% over the last year, and 1,897% for USD Coin. 24 
hour exchange turnover in Tether is nearly $120 billion. This is 
comparable to the daily volume at the NYSE and almost 15 times the daily
 flow in money market mutual funds. Narrow bid-ask spreads and depth 
have attracted active HFT participation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This study contrasts different effects of applying blockchain 
technology on a social norm of trust and individual behaviour. The 
advanced technological features of blockchain could either complete 
contractual information and prevent coordination failures by 
substituting the need for trust or allow for some degree of 
incompleteness in information and favour a reciprocal mechanism of trust
 to solve for inefficiencies arising out of it. Either way, incomplete 
information is a necessary condition for the emergence of social norms 
of trust and reciprocity; hence a change in the completion of 
contractual information influences the institutional setting that market
 mechanisms are embedded in. One evolutionary process drives both, the 
degree of information available and behavioural traits within the 
society. Technology is neutral, but the way it is applied has different 
consequences on the institutional setting and thus favours different 
individual behavioural traits. Blockchain technology might either 
substitute or complement the need for trust</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article explores an inflection point for the crypto 
community as it grappled with a series of cascading failures. Drawing on
 3 years of ethnographic observation and interviews at conferences 
devoted to building privacy systems, I consider how a determinist 
conception of encryption technologies inhibited the widespread adoption 
of privacy technologies. I develop the frame of “survival of the 
cryptic” to call attention to the way this conception fails to 
acknowledge how power shapes the conditions of surveillance: that race 
and racism, gender and misogyny affect not only who is most impacted by 
surveillance but also how the encryption technologies developed to 
inhibit surveillance were designed—and, as importantly, who they were 
designed for. I conclude by offering a new imaginary for encryption that
 draws on queer, black and feminist thought by centering the need to 
create safe and autonomous spaces for collective survival under 
conditions of mass surveillance.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Cryptocurrencies are all the rage, but there is nothing new 
about privately produced money. The goal of private money is to be 
accepted at par with no questions asked. This did not occur during the 
Free Banking Era in the United States—a period that most resembles the 
current world of stablecoins. State-chartered banks in the Free Banking 
Era experienced panics, and their private monies made it very hard to 
transact because of fluctuating prices. That system was curtailed by the
 National Bank Act of 1863, which created a uniform national currency 
backed by U.S. Treasury bonds. Subsequent legislation taxed the 
state-chartered banks' paper currencies out of existence in favor of a 
single sovereign currency. The newest type of private money is now upon 
us—in the form of stablecoins like “Tether” and Facebook's “Diem” 
(formerly “Libra”). Based on lessons learned from history, we argue that
 privately produced monies are not an effective medium of exchange 
because they are not always accepted at par and are subject to runs. We 
present proposals to address the systemic risks created by stablecoins, 
including regulating stablecoin issuers as banks and issuing a central 
bank digital currency</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Bitcoin introduced delegation of control over a monetary 
system from a select few to all who participate in that system. This 
delegation is known as the decentralization of controlling power and is a
 powerful security mechanism for the ecosystem. After the introduction 
of Bitcoin, the field of cryptocurrency has seen widespread attention 
from industry and academia, so much so that the original novel 
contribution of Bitcoin, i.e., decentralization, may be overlooked, due 
to decentralizations' assumed fundamental existence for the functioning 
of such crypto-assets. However, recent studies have observed a trend of 
increased centralization in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and 
Ethereum. As this increased centralization has an impact the security of
 the blockchain, it is crucial that it is measured, towards adequate 
control. This research derives an initial taxonomy of centralization 
present in decentralized blockchains through rigorous synthesis using a 
systematic literature review. This is followed by iterative refinement 
through expert interviews. We systematically analyzed 89 research papers
 published between 2009 and 2019. Our study contributes to the existing 
body of knowledge by highlighting the multiple definitions and 
measurements of centralization in the literature. We identify different 
aspects of centralization and propose an encompassing taxonomy of 
centralization concerns. This taxonomy is based on empirically 
observable and measurable characteristics. It consists of 13 aspects of 
centralization, classified over six architectural layers: Governance, 
Network, Consensus, Incentive, Operational, and Application. We also 
discuss how the implications of centralization can vary depending on the
 aspects studied. We believe that this review and taxonomy provides a 
comprehensive overview of centralization in decentralized blockchains 
involving various conceptualizations and measures.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Despite the increase in literature on financial innovation as a
 force of change in the financial system, most contributions fail to 
analyze the relationship between the socio-institutional and 
technological design of cryptocurrencies. This paper aims to fill this 
gap by providing a case study of Bitcoin, the most representative of the
 virtual and cryptocurrencies. We begin by addressing the concept of 
financial innovation as a social phenomenon embedded in networks of 
users, technologists, regulations, institutions, culture and history. 
Secondly, we examine the disruptive and evolutionary nature of the 
Bitcoin, comparing it with the characteristics of legal tender money. 
The main conclusions indicate that although Bitcoin represents a 
disruptive technology in the process of monetary creation through a 
peer-to-peer network, it is not a new conception of money in its 
institutional dimension.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In recent years, warnings of a populist threat to central bank
 independence have proliferated. These warnings are based on a 
deep-seated antagonism between technocracy and populism. I argue that to
 understand current challenges for central banks, we should question the
 assumed antagonism between populism and technocracy. Political 
scientists Chris Bickerton and Carlo Accetti (2021) claim that advanced 
democratic states today are in a technopopulist age, “increasingly 
ordered around the combination of appeals to the people and to expertise
 and competence” (pg. 157). This paper discusses central bank 
independence in the technopopulist age. First, I describe the inherent 
tension around the role of expertise in a democracy, and how this 
tension has been approached in the delegation of monetary policymaking 
to independent central banks. Next, I discuss the transition from an era
 of ideological political logic to the current era of technopopulism. 
Then I explain how the technopopulist influence is especially evident in
 recent pressures on central banks, changes in central bank 
communication, and recent amendments to the Federal Reserve's longer-run
 strategy. An important point is that under technopopulism, populists do
 not reject technocratic expertise, but instead rely on it to translate 
their causes into policy. Central banks thus face pressure to use their 
technocratic discretion to do more to serve the people, and to be 
directly accountability to the people rather than to elected 
representatives. In return for greater responsiveness, they gain even 
greater power and discretion.</td>

			<h2>The alter-politics of complementary currencies: The case of Sardex</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper addresses the question whether complementary 
currencies can help us think and practice politics in new and different 
ways which contribute to democratic change and civic empowerment in our 
times. The space created by the Sardex complementary currency circuit in
 Sardinia (2009-to date) seems to leave enough room for the emergence of
 a collective micropolitical consciousness. At the same time, the design
 of a technological and financial infrastructure is also an alternative 
political, or “alter-political” choice. Both are alternative to 
hegemonic politics and to typical modes of mobilization and 
contestation. Thus, the Sardex circuit can best be understood as an 
alter-political combination of the bottom-up micropolitics of personal 
interactions within the circuit and of the politics of technology 
implicit in the top-down design of the technological and financial 
infrastructure underpinning the circuit. The Sardex experience suggests 
that a market that mediates the (local) real economy only and shuts out 
the financial economy can provide economic sustainability by supporting 
SMEs, supply a shield against the adverse effects of financial crises, 
and counteract the fetishization of money by disclosing daily its roots 
in social construction within a controlled environment of mutual 
responsibility, solidarity, and trust. We broached the Sardex currency 
and circuit in such terms in order to illustrate a significant and 
effective instance of alter-politics in our times and also to indicate, 
more specifically, community financial innovations which could be taken 
up and re-deployed to democratize or “commonify” local economies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The subjects of this dissertation are distributed consensus 
systems (DCS). These systems gained prominence with the implementation 
of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. This work aims at understanding 
the drivers and motives behind the adoption of this class of 
technologies, and to – consequently – evaluate the social and normative 
implications of blockchains and distributed ledgers. To do so, a 
phenomenological account of the field of distributed consensus systems 
is offered, then the core claims for the adoption of systems are taken 
into consideration. Accordingly, the relevance of these technologies on 
trust and governance is examined. It will be argued that the effects on 
these two elements do not justify the adoption of distributed consensus 
systems satisfactorily. Against this backdrop, it will be held that 
blockchains and similar technologies are being adopted because they are 
regarded as having a valid claim to authority as specified by Max Weber,
 i.e., herrschaft. Consequently, it will be discussed whether current 
implementations fall – and to what extent – within the legitimate types 
of traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal authority. The 
conclusion is that the conceptualization developed by Weber does not 
capture the core ideas that appear to establish the belief in the 
legitimacy of distributed consensus systems. Therefore, this 
dissertation describes the herrschaft of systems such as blockchains by 
conceptualizing a computational extension of the pure type of 
rational-legal authority, qualified as algorithmic authority. The 
foundational elements of algorithmic authority are then discussed. 
Particular attention is focused on the idea of normativity cultivated in
 systems of algorithmic rules as well as the concept of 
decentralization. Practical suggestions conclude the following 
dissertation.</td>

						<td>The global financial crisis and the contemporaneous emergence 
of the digital currency Bitcoin invite us to think about money and how 
it often functions almost imperceptibly in society. In this article, we 
show that Bitcoin is a ‘new object of concern' that also compels us to 
reimagine ethnography in a digital age. We present a method, which we 
term ethno-resonance, that is both a reaction to the conditions 
presented by the Bitcoin phenomenon and a way of maintaining critical 
distance from its cyberlibertarian politics. We explicate six aspects of
 the method, framed around answers to what, why, how, who, when and 
where questions. Applied to cryptocurrencies, the method leads us to 
depict Bitcoin as a game, and we analyse the game's dynamics through 
mapping the interplay between four foundational myths that animate, 
complicate and sustain the game. More broadly, this contributes to our 
understanding of the nature of money and alternative currencies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain technologies are rapidly being developed and tested
 in a broad range of business and governmental settings. Their unique 
cryp­to­graphic char­ac­ter­is­tics and con­fig­u­ra­tions enable users 
of these systems to transact directly and anonymously. The data these 
users generate are timestamped and immutable. In open blockhains, 
individual users take responsibility for managing and protecting their 
own data and for ensuring the reliability of the parties with whom they 
transact. The socio-material characteristics of these systems will 
influence user attitudes and behaviors in ways that are profound and 
difficult to predict. Outcomes have not yet been researched, and the 
academy has adopted a stance of technological determinism despite the 
fact that implicit assumptions about outcomes are literally coded in as 
these systems are developed. We envision potential impacts that may 
result from self-sovereign ownership of data including: commoditization 
of the self and relationships with others, the need to police personal 
data and reputation, and new perceptions of time and history that result
 from transaction sequentialization and permanence. Further research on 
the societal impacts of blockchain technologies is needed as these 
systems become ubiquitous.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper addresses the design dilemmas that arise when 
distributed ledger technologies (DLT) are to be applied in the 
governance of artificial material commons. DLTs, such as blockchain, are
 often presented as enabling technologies for self-governing 
communities, provided by their consensus mechanisms, transparent 
administration, and incentives for collaboration and cooperation. Yet, 
these affordances may also undermine public values such as privacy and 
displace human agency in governance procedures. In this paper, the 
conflicts regarding the governance of communities which collectively 
manage and produce a commons are discussed through the case of a 
fictional energy community. Three mechanisms are identified in this 
process: tracking use of and contributions to the commons; managing 
resources, and negotiating the underlying rule sets and user rights. Our
 effort is aimed at contributing to the HCI community by introducing a 
framework of three mechanisms and six design dilemmas that can aid in 
balancing conflicting values in the design of local platforms for 
commons-based resource management.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this paper, we engage in a philosophical investigation of 
how blockchain technologies such as cryptocurrencies can mediate our 
social world. Emerging blockchain-based decentralised applications have 
the potential to transform our financial system, our bureaucracies and 
models of governance. We construct an ontological framework of 
“narrative technologies” that allows us to show how these technologies, 
like texts, can configure our social reality. Drawing from the work of 
Ricoeur and responding to the works of Searle, in postphenomenology and 
STS, we show how blockchain technologies bring about a process of 
emplotment: an organisation of characters and events. First, we show how
 blockchain technologies actively configure plots such as financial 
transactions by rendering them increasingly rigid. Secondly, we show how
 they configure abstractions from the world of action, by replacing 
human interactions with automated code. Third, we investigate the role 
of people's interpretative distances towards blockchain technologies: 
discussing the importance of greater public involvement with their 
application in different realms of social life.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain can be used to build a human-centric future. This 
is a challenge to recent critical literature on blockchain that sees it 
as another manifestation of digital capitalism that is profoundly 
antisocial and anti-human. This argument is in three parts. The first 
part identifies in the hype and critical literatures about blockchain, 
the blockchain conundrum of the freedom/constraint dyad. While tempting 
to see these literatures as forming a sealed hermeneutic of 
over-positive meets over-negative, it is argued that the critical 
discourse in locating blockchain within digital capitalism provides an 
insight that could unravel the blockchain conundrum. The critical 
literature identifies regulation as essential for human blockchain 
futures. The second part unravels the blockchain conundrum through this 
focus on regulation–through two accounts of law, technology and society;
 Lessig's notion of actors as ‘pathetic dots' and Brownsword's reimaging
 of regulation in technological societies. It is suggested that 
Brownsword's emphasis provides a more nuanced way to make human-centric 
blockchain futures. The final part builds from Brownsword's resolution 
of the blockchain conundrum, to examine a particular blockchain 
application in retail supply (BeefLedger) as representing assemblages 
including blockchains in building human-centric futures through trusted 
communities that enable, rather than restrict, meaningful human action.</td>

						<td>Blockchain is a technology with many applications derived from
 its properties. This article analyzes the case of 4 cooperative 
agroecological supermarkets and in what circumstances blockchain is an 
exciting technology to adopt. The analysis of the gathered data reveals 
10 factors to consider, 5 internal and 5 external. Those factors derive 
into 6 blockchain domains to develop. The article concludes that in 3 of
 them, the drawbacks of implementing the technology, although it is 
theoretically appropriate, are insuperable. The article contributes to 
demystifying blockchain technology and applying the same business logic 
we use with other technical options.</td>

						<td>Blockchain technology has its roots in the cryptocurrency 
Bitcoin, which was the first successful attempt to validate transactions
 via a decentralized data protocol. This validation process requires 
vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant level 
of carbon emissions. Our approximation of Bitcoin's carbon footprint 
underlines the need to tackle the environmental externalities that 
result from cryptocurrencies. Blockchain solutions are increasingly 
discussed for a broad variety of use cases beyond cryptocurrencies. 
Although not all blockchain protocols are as energy intensive as 
Bitcoin's protocol, environmental aspects, the risk of collusion, and 
concerns about control must not be ignored in the debate on anticipated 
benefits. Our findings for the first stage of blockchain diffusion and 
the externalities we discuss may help policy-makers in setting the right
 rules as the adoption journey of blockchain technology has just 
started.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Local Currencies, Local Exchange Trading Systems, and Time 
Banks are all part of a new social movement that aims to restrict 
money's purchasing power within a certain geographic area, or within a 
certain community. According to their proponents, these restrictions may
 contribute to building sustainable local economies, supporting local 
businesses and creating “warmer” social relations. This article inquires
 whether the overall enthusiasm that surrounds alternative currencies is
 justified. It argues that the potential benefits of these currencies 
are not sufficient to justify the restrictions they impose on money's 
purchasing power. Turning these currencies into effective channels of 
change, by increasing their scope and their strength, could severely 
hinder the pursuit of social justice, in a way that is probably not even
 necessary for achieving their objectives. The paper concludes that 
large-scale limitations of money's purchasing power are, therefore, 
undesirable.</td>

			<h2>The Challenge of Building a Scalable Postcapitalist Commons: The Limits of FairCoin as a Commons-Based Cryptocurrency</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Postcapitalist commons are a growing area of interest in the 
efforts to generate alternatives to capitalism in the present. Commons 
are understood as self-organised collectives based around shared 
resources; yet postcapitalist commons have an additional element, in 
operating within while projecting an “after” capitalism. This can give 
rise to tensions since commons striving for postcapitalism also require a
 certain amount of capital to survive and function within capitalism. 
FairCoop is a radical postcapitalist commons that adopted the 
cryptocurrency FairCoin in 2014. FairCoop, through FairCoin, was able to
 generate some trans-local connections through its use of peer2peer 
technologies and was thus able to scale-up. Its design, however, was 
ultimately unsustainable due to insufficiently clear boundaries from 
capital. After highlighting the lack of commons boundaries around 
FairCoop, we identify some additional commons-capital boundary design 
principles which could contribute to the sustainability of future 
postcapitalist commons experiments that are seeking to scale.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Due to the investment and diversification potential, 
cryptocurrencies are considered to be attractive for both sophisticated 
and amateur investors. However, the high levels of electricity 
consumption of the hashing is a significant environmental concern, 
specifically in China, with dominant coal-based electricity production. 
This paper assesses the impact of price and policy uncertainties of the 
cryptocurrencies on the investment flows of the funds that have been 
sorted as per their exposure towards coal and natural gas firms. 
Therefore, we have employed the data for 1920 funds, between the time 
span pertaining to the years 2014 and 2021. Our findings show that both 
policy and price uncertainty tend to have an impact on the investment 
flows in high carbon funds, while these uncertainties have no 
relationship with the low emission funds. The results also indicate that
 the impact tends to be more profound for the younger funds. The 
performance of cryptos and their link with investment flows can limit 
the transition to low carbon sustainable options. We therefore propose 
that policymakers further ensure a swift adoption of renewable resources
 for electricity production, in order to successfully mitigate the 
climate impact. This could ultimately aid in promoting green investment 
flows.</td>

			<h2>The Curious Case of Stablecoins—Balancing Risks and Rewards?</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Stablecoins is a blockchain-driven innovation and a new subset
 of crypto assets. Even though they could transform how payments are 
made, regulators paid little attention to them until recently. The 
announcement of the Libra project in 2019 elevated stablecoins to the 
top of the regulatory agenda. Libra's global scale and its capacity to 
reach billions of potential users through a user-centric social network 
platform that is already seamlessly integrated within the lives of the 
global population and the potential impact of a global yet fast and 
cheap payment solution raised many issues and concerns among authorities
 related to not only financial stability, monetary policy, and 
competition, but also money laundering, financing of terrorism, and 
others. Addressing stablecoins has proven challenging for many 
regulators as they face a difficult task of balancing financial 
stability, with innovation. This paper analyzes how the official 
perception of stablecoins has evolved, from dismissiveness and 
underestimation to serious concern. It evaluates existing regulatory 
responses, highlights regulatory dilemmas, and makes recommendations 
regarding future regulatory approaches. To reap the benefits of 
stablecoin innovation, regulators need to take a broader long-term view 
of stablecoins beyond the perceived risks and embrace their advantages. 
Regulations should not stifle this innovation but support a diverse 
ecosystem of stablecoins and foster competition.</td>

						<td>This paper reviews the recent case of The DAO “hack” in June 
2016 and analyzes The DAO's response in its time of crisis, and its 
implications for corporate and IT governance. There was no human-led 
governance in The DAO. Instead, The DAO placed its trust in the smart 
contract they had built together on the blockchain, which became its 
governance mechanism. The events that follow allow us to see hitherto 
unobservable organizational behaviors that are unique to trustless 
organizations, and hence The DAO gives us a glimpse at a new species of 
corporate governance. This paper explores the implications of these 
ideas: we propose the emergence of a spectrum of organizations based on 
the alienation of trust, we consider the economic impact and legality of
 decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), smart contracts, work 
and job design, and what happens when corporate governance is managed 
solely by IT governance.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Countless decentralized finance (DeFi) applications of the 
past years have suffered from the high volatility and speculative 
behavior surrounding their underlying crypto assets. While the academic 
debate has been flourishing in these areas, Decentralized Autonomous 
Organizations (DAOs) have not received as much attention. This is the 
case even though they could offer an opportunity to solve some of the 
underlying problems of existing cryptocurrencies and ecosystems, for 
example, by providing lower volatility and, thus, exchange rate 
stability. This paper presents an economic analysis of the MakerDAO, a 
DAO in DeFi. In doing so, we use a single case study methodology based 
on existing resources and expert interviews. It also uses monetary 
theory instruments to provide researchers and developers with insights 
into how DAOs are governed. Further, it serves to illustrate how IS 
research may support the development of future IT artifacts aimed at 
offering the infrastructure for DeFi applications.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The emergent power of big data analytics makes it possible to 
replace impersonal general legal rules with personalized, particular 
norms. We consider arguments that such a move would be generally 
beneficial, replacing crude, general laws with more efficiently targeted
 ways of meeting public policy goals and satisfying personal 
preferences. Those proposals pose a radical, new challenge to the rule 
of law. Data-driven legal personalization offers some benefits that are 
worth pursuing, but we argue that the benefits can only legitimately be 
pursued where doing so is consistent with the agency that the law ought 
to accord to individuals and with the agency that the law ought to 
accord to public bodies. The principle of public agency is a 
prerequisite for the rule of law. The principle of private agency 
depends on the rule of law. Each is incompatible with the unrestrained 
computational personalization of law.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Recent advances in science mapping allowed to analyze the 
entire intellectual structure of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in 
business-related disciplines to identify 174 academic articles as well 
as 1482 practitioner-oriented articles published since the inception of 
cryptocurrencies in 2008 to highlight key trends of the published 
outputs. The results demonstrate academic research done by 389 authors 
in 296 organizations based in 50 countries that only just initiated the 
conversation on four major streams of the literature—Bitcoin and 
cryptocurrencies; blockchain adoption; cryptocurrency and blockchain 
environment; and business model innovations. When comparing academic 
scholarship to practitioner-oriented literature, the results demonstrate
 that practitioners discussed investor-related themes, cryptocurrency 
intrinsic value, political-economic sphere, and the impact of 
cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies on the wider society in 
greater detail. As a result, a number of themes are identified and 
discussed that could align academic and practitioner interests and 
provide guidance for further research in this important field.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Illegal use of electricity is very common in cryptocurrency 
mining farms, as energy bills are the most important component of the 
cost of cryptocurrency production. In this case, it raises the issue of 
how to detect illegal cryptocurrency mining. Innovative approaches are 
needed to identify data centers that illegally mine cryptocurrencies. 
This study proposes the use of unique noise and/or harmonic features of 
cryptocurrency generating machines to detect illegal cryptocurrency 
mining farms. Within the scope of this study, the characteristic 
harmonics originating from the data centers were determined by 
performing field tests on the neutral line of the electrical grid. In 
this study, it has been shown that electricity distribution companies 
can detect illegal cryptocurrency data centers using potential illegal 
electricity by monitoring energy quality data. Legal permissions can be 
obtained easily for detailed examination and detection in cryptocurrency
 data centers of using illegal electricity. With the proposed innovative
 approach, the time taken to detect illegal cryptocurrency mining farms 
using illegal electricity is reduced.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With technology progressing and the decreasing cost of 
renewable energy, consumers require energy supply to be smarter, 
cleaner, and more sustainable than before. By providing a decentralized 
trading mechanism, blockchain technology can facilitate sustainable 
energy consumption and achieve a circular economy. This study analyzes 
how China can employ blockchain technology to reform its energy sector. 
We survey the progress of blockchain technology in the energy sector and
 explore typical cases of energy blockchains in the world. We discuss 
the advantages and disadvantages of applying blockchain to China's 
energy sector. China's monopoly market structure in energy supply 
impedes the application of blockchain technology, but the expansion of 
clean energy provides a huge opportunity for it. Although China's 
technological level is lagging, the biggest obstacle is not technology 
but rather policy. We conclude that China should loosen its regulatory 
environment, amend the relevant laws, and balance the conflict between 
management and innovation.</td>

perspective, first questioning its unusual legitimation system, backed 
by the so called ‘blockchain technology', instead of by governmental 
authorities. Then we collect data and elements to reconstruct Bitcoin's 
history as a cryptocurrency, starting from the mysterious story 
surrounding its birth. We then follow its spread and development through
 social networks and words of mouth, together with its sudden booms and 
bursts, finally to suggest that both users and institutional regulators

challenge our very notion of money.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Peer-to-peer networks and protocols have inspired new ideas 
and ideologies about governance, with the aim of using technology to 
enable horizontal and decentralized decision-making at scale. This 
article introduces the concept of “dissensus” from political theory to 
debates about peer governance in online communities. Dissensus describes
 the emergence of incompatible differences. Among peer-to-peer 
technologies, blockchain stands out as a set of ideas that explicitly 
seek to resolve dissensus through consensus protocols. In this article, 
we propose dissensus as a “protocol” for foregrounding the often 
sidelined yet productive aspects of incompatible differences. The 
concept highlights that there might not always be consensus about a 
consensus algorithm, and that indeed, dissensus is the precondition for 
new possibilities and perspectives to emerge. We discuss the concept in 
relation to the histories of governance ideas in blockchain, namely, a 
“materialist,” “design,” and “emergent” approach. We then describe 
moments of dissensus in practice through two cases of online 
communities, Genesis DAO and Ouishare, discussing their different ways 
of recognizing and navigating dissensus. Finally, we give a critical 
overview of consensus algorithms, voting, staking, and forking as the 
mechanisms that make out blockchain governance ideologies. In 
conclusion, we argue that dissensus can serve as a useful concept for 
pointing attention to governance as it is conducted in practice, as 
historically and culturally specific practices, rather than as a problem
 to be solved through supposedly universal mechanisms.</td>

						<td>Revisiting analytically the notion of embeddedness and its 
connections with the concept of trust, this paper shows that contrary to
 Bitcoin's premises and promises to be a trust-low or even trust-less 
currency, trust enters the system at many various levels and with 
different nuances. Applying a conceptual framework that conceives 
embeddedness as both the possible source and outcome of trust, it is 
pointed out that Bitcoin should better be regarded as doubly embedded: 
in technology and in its peculiar social structure. Due to the existence
 of computational and cognitive asymmetries within the system, in fact, 
trust is necessary for the very functioning of this new form of money, 
as well as for its future prospects.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>How does monetization affect interpersonal relationships? 
Drawing on social phenomenology, I argue that an answer must account for
 money's symbolic dualism: On the one hand, as Zelizer has shown, money 
is differentially earmarked according to the interpersonal relationships
 it flows through. On the other hand, in everyday life, people tend to 
associate money with cold impersonality. Money's dual association with 
both the interpersonal and the impersonal imbues the relationships it 
flows through with a sense of risk, which I call “the risk of lost 
meanings.” Analyzing the implications of this sense of risk, I argue 
that it turns trust into a relational preoccupation and constrains 
intersubjective experience. The risk of lost meanings may motivate 
risk-avoidance strategies, but these strategies are largely 
counterproductive. Shedding new light on a long-standing debate in the 
sociology of money, I discuss the implications of this argument for 
analyses of monetary developments and local currencies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The controversies surrounding Bitcoin, one of the most 
frequently used and advertised cryptocurrency, are focused on 
identifying its qualities, the advantages and disadvantages of using it 
and, last but not least, its ability to survive over time and become a 
viable alternative to the traditional currency, taking into account the 
effects on the environment of the technology used to extract and trade 
it. Based on such considerations, this article aims to provide an 
overview of this cryptocurrency, from the perspective of conducting a 
systematic review of the literature dedicated to the economic and 
environmental impact of Bitcoin. Using peer-reviewed articles collected 
from academic databases, we aimed at synthesizing and critically 
evaluating the points of view in the scientific literature regarding the
 doctrinal source of the emergence of Bitcoin, the identity of this 
cryptocurrency from an economic point of view, following its 
implications on the economic and social environment. Subsequently, this 
research offers the opportunity of evaluating the level of knowledge 
considering the impact of Bitcoin mining process on the environment from
 the perspective of the energy consumption and CO2 emissions, in order 
to finally analyze Bitcoin regulation and identify possible solutions to
 reduce the negative impact on the environment and beyond. The findings 
suggest that, despite high energy consumption and adverse environmental 
impact, Bitcoin continues to be an instrument used in the economic 
environment for a variety of purposes. Moreover, the trend of regulating
 it in various countries shows that the use of Bitcoin is beginning to 
gain some legitimacy, despite criticism against this cryptocurrency.</td>

						<td>The latest wave of cryptomania has brought us yet another 
acronym after ICOs (initial coin offerings) – NFTs (non-fungible 
tokens). Touted as a means to render readily replicable digital art (and
 possibly other objects) rare and scarce, NFT-mania reached its apogee 
with the auction of Beeple's Everydays: the First 5,000 Days for US$69m.
 But did the buyer actually acquire, through the NFT, any art? What is 
art abstracted from the medium upon which it is embedded and dissociated
 from its copyright?</td>

						<td>Starting from the premise that the financial regime has become
 a power in and of itself-a fourth, 'monetative' power as it were-this 
essay gives an account of the ascendancy of finance and the shift from 
geopolitical to geo-economical order, within which there is no 
democratic legitimacy and no legal accountability and within which a new
 class conflict also emerges. It goes on to advance five theses on this 
new financial sovereignty, concluding that sovereign is he, who can 
transform his risks into other's dangers and position himself as the 
creditor of last resort.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain is a buzzword describing the current excitement for
 an innovative technology that could change and disrupt major industries
 and economic sectors. Blockchain technology has the promise to change 
all existing business models and make financial services cheaper 
contributing therefore to a better financial inclusion and, even a 
better economic wealth distribution. Numerous studies optimistically 
praise such potential societal benefits by listing all processes that 
could be optimized through this technology. However, the picture is not 
necessary all bright. Blockchain can indeed disrupt and significantly 
improve our societies but there still exist some societal costs in the 
way this technology is implemented. This paper provides a perspective 
overviewing of the current trends related to the development of the most
 widely used implementation of blockchain technology based on the 
proof-of-work consensus algorithm. These trends will be discussed in 
three steps: the ‘Good Blockchain' overviews how this technology can 
improve our societies; the ‘Bad blockchain' offers a more nuanced 
perspective by discussing the potential polluting activities generated 
by some mining activities. Finally, the ‘Ugly blockchain' investigates 
how this technology might generate a risk of concentration in the mining
 industry affecting therefore the nature and even the existence of the 
blockchain technology.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The meteoric growth of global cryptocurrency markets presents 
novel challenges to regulators. Some policymakers and scholars view 
cryptocurrencies as conduits of illegality and fraud and call for their 
strict regulation, even outright bans. Others warn that regulation will 
cause trading activity to cross borders into less-regulated 
jurisdictions-or even smother a promising new financial asset class. Yet
 this debate has, to date, been conducted almost entirely without data. 
To assess the claims of both sides, we assemble original data on 
cryptocurrency regulations worldwide and use them to empirically examine
 global movement in trading activity following key regulatory 
announcements. Our findings are surprising. A wide variety of models 
yields almost entirely null results. From the creation of bespoke 
licensing regimes to more targeted anti-money-laundering and anti-fraud 
enforcement actions, as well as many other categories of government 
activities, we find no systemic evidence that regulatory measures cause 
traders to flee, or enter into, the affected jurisdictions. These 
findings at last provide an empirical basis for regulatory decisions 
concerning cryptocurrency trading. Among other things, they call into 
question the notion that capital flight should be a first-order concern.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Bitcoin is a decentralised currency and payment system that 
seeks to eliminate the need for trusted authorities. It relies on a 
peer-to-peer network and cryptographic protocols to perform the 
functions of traditional financial intermediaries, such as verifying 
transactions and preserving the integrity of the system. This article 
examines the political economy of Bitcoin, in light of a recent dispute 
that divided the Bitcoin community with regard to a seemingly simple 
technical issue: Whether or not to increase the block size of the 
Bitcoin blockchain. By looking at the socio-technical constructs of 
Bitcoin, the article distinguishes between two distinct coordination 
mechanisms: Governance by the infrastructure (achieved via the Bitcoin 
protocol) and governance of the infrastructure (managed by the community
 of developers and other stakeholders). It then analyses the invisible 
politics inherent in these two mechanisms, which together display a 
highly technocratic power structure. On the one hand, as an attempt to 
be self-governing and self-sustaining, the Bitcoin network exhibits a 
strong market-driven approach to social trust and coordination, which 
has been embedded directly into the technical protocol. On the other 
hand, despite being an open source project, the development and 
maintenance of the Bitcoin code ultimately relies on a small core of 
highly skilled developers who play a key role in the design of the 
platform.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain technology is a new general-purpose technology that
 poses significant challenges to the existing state of law, economy, and
 society. Blockchain has one feature that makes it even more distinctive
 than other disruptive technologies: It is, by nature and design, global
 and transnational. Moreover, blockchain operates based on its own rules
 and principles that have a law-like quality. What may be called the lex
 cryptographia of blockchain has been designed based on a rational 
choice vision of human behavior. Blockchain adopts a framing derived 
from neoclassical economics, and instantiates it in a new machinery that
 implements rational choice paradigms using blockchain in a 
semi-automatic way, across all spheres of life, and without regard to 
borders. Accordingly, a global law and cryptoeconomics movement is now 
emerging owing to the spread of blockchain.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Should political elections be implemented on the blockchain? 
Blockchain evangelists have argued that they should. This article sheds 
light on the potential of blockchain voting procedures and the legal 
constraints they need to accommodate. In a first step, I discuss 
potential “democracy benefits” of distributed ledger technology and the 
legal framework ordering the use of electronic voting systems in 
general. Comparing U.S. and German constitutional law, I then distill 
specific normative principles guiding the use of blockchain voting 
systems. In a second step, I analyze the technical, economic, and 
normative limitations of blockchain voting procedures. I show that major
 limitations result from the rules and incentives set by different 
consensus mechanisms. Moreover, it is not clear whether blockchain 
technology provides sufficient safeguards to ensure identity 
verification, the secrecy of ballots, and the verification that ballots 
are cast as intended, recorded as cast, and counted as recorded. 
Building on principles from constitutional law, I contend that 
blockchain technology does not provide sufficient safeguards to satisfy 
the requirements of democratic voting procedures – at least not in the 
near future.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article presents a socio-anthropological analysis of the 
formation of a business ecosystem around blockchain technology in the 
Netherlands, within the broader context of the European Union and the 
digital single market. I argue that while reproducing widespread global 
models of business group and network formation, the relations created by
 these networks also reveal particularities of local business and 
governance cultures. Such particularities emerge from the pragmatics of 
collaboration and competitive market relationships, as well as legal 
heterogeneity and plans for legal harmonisation in digital innovation 
and governance in Europe. They also emerge from the challenges and 
transformations that current experimentation cultures for digital 
innovation bring to the interactions between market players, regulators,
 and government. These challenges and transformations materialise in 
increasingly informal connections and strategies for experimental 
legitimisation, which occur in parallel to more formal and traditional 
forms of regulatory and governmental interaction. The article is based 
on ethnographic fieldwork in the Netherlands and in online terrains, 
including observation periods and 32 interviews with entrepreneurial 
project teams, as well as with individuals involved in financial 
incumbents' innovation labs.</td>

modern life: money and value. This dissertation undertakes a set of 
interrelated investigations into the collective processes of social 
construction and valuation that have been part of this ascent. The first
 study begins by considering the challenge that digital currencies pose 
to established economic models of the origins of money and value. Using a
 series of agent-based models (ABM) based on Bayesian updating agents, 
it shows how sociological models of value construction may be able to 
help solve this theoretical problem. Specifically, it shows how treating
 valuation as a process of learning under uncertainty clarifies how 
“something” can legitimately come from “nothing” in social valuation 
processes. It also shows how this model can be used to systematically 
explore the differences between social versus non-social valuation 
processes, the dependency of social valuation processes on time, initial
 states, and early actors, and how a mix of non-social and social 
feedbacks can impede a system's ability to arrive at the “correct” 
assessment of an object's underlying value. The second study uses text 
gathered from 100,000s of messages posted by individuals in the main 
communities surrounding Bitcoin and a combination of automated and 
traditional content analysis to explore the “talks” (Swidler 2001) of 
money and value that individuals have employed to make sense of this new
 monetary object. The resulting analysis traces the manner in which the 
initial metallist views that first inspired Bitcoin's creation continue 
to influence the discourses surrounding it, and then goes further to 
unpack the ways in which members have had to go beyond those founding 
ideas in order to account for how the new digital currency has come to 
hold value. In exploring these variegated, sometimes contradictory, 
discussions of the economic, political, and social origins of money and 
value, this analysis sheds light on the ways the individuals at the 
advent of digital currency are making sense of this new arena of 
economic activity and how they are creatively reworking established 
notions of money and value in order to understand what Bitcoin is and 
where its worth comes from. The final study takes on the puzzle of how 
Bitcoin has gone from being an obscure monetary experiment of a small 
group of “techno-Libertarians” to becoming the basis of a new 
multi-billion dollar financial technology industry – an industry 
dominated by the very same actors it was initially intended to subvert. 
Using the documented history of Bitcoin's evolution, the application of 
automated content analysis and topic modeling methods to thousands of 
news reports, and analyses of trends in quantitative measures of Bitcoin
 related Google searches, venture capital funding, and price and market 
transaction volumes, this chapter shows how Bitcoin's multivalent 
identity has facilitated its adoption by a multiplicity of groups, but 
also, ultimately left it vulnerable to being preferentially defined in 
ways that benefit powerful actors. In charting the rise of Bitcoin and 
linking it to the collective definitional processes that have surrounded
 it, this study chapter examines the social dynamics that surround 
“robust objects” and the role that these processes play in the 
reproduction of power structures in new social and economic fields.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this paper, we present an ethnographic account of the 
quasi-religious romanticism of the crypto-community towards blockchain 
technologies. To do so, we explore the cultural significance of 
phenomena such as myth, faith, and ritual, without excluding both the 
realms of technological practices and techno-scientific narrative. 
Drawing on a comparison with the legend of King Arthur, we analyse how 
the legendary creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, translates 
contemporary anxieties resulting from the financial crisis and the 
centralisation of power. By analysing white papers, we further explore 
the persuasive narratives which convey how ethics and virtue can be 
encoded into software, and, finally, we describe the secular rituals 
that reinforce cohesion among the community–in moments which are often 
guided by charismatic preachers and specialists. We argue that 
blockchain technologies have had a symbolic impact in re-invigorating 
enchantment and material romanticism towards finance and technology, 
which has had a wider impact on the social perception and acceptance of 
the transition to a digital society.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>There is a wealth of information, hype around, and research 
into blockchain's ‘disruptive' and ‘transformative' potential concerning
 every industry. However, there is an absence of scholarly attention 
given to identifying and analyzing the political premises and 
consequences of blockchain projects. Through digital ethnography and 
participatory action research, this article shows how blockchain 
experiments personify ‘prefigurative politics' by design: they embody 
the politics and power structures which they want to enable in society. 
By showing how these prefigurative embodiments are informed and 
determined by the underlying political imaginaries, the article proposes
 a basic typology of blockchain projects. Furthermore, it outlines a 
frame to question, cluster, and analyze the expressions of political 
imaginaries intrinsic to the design and operationalization of blockchain
 projects on three analytic levels: users, intermediaries, and 
institutions.</td>

						<td>This paper considers the potential of blockchain technology to
 empower distributed and decentralized local electricity markets. 
Although blockchain has gained considerable attention in the last few 
years as a facilitator for new electricity markets, no attention has yet
 been given to its potential influence on the configuration of the 
actors in the electricity system and its ability to transform the 
existing system. Based on a social network analysis, this paper 
investigates how blockchain can influence the actor configuration of the
 electricity system in the Netherlands. After describing the Dutch 
system, we compare the existing with the potential future system' actor 
configuration and the corresponding expected shifts in functions and 
network position of the actors. We conclude that although many functions
 are likely to remain and new central authorities may be formed, the 
impact of blockchain does not seem to be as disruptive and 
decentralizing as may be expected. This study provides first 
contributions to the ongoing discussion about the potential of 
blockchain to disrupt and reshape the electricity system.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Many commentators have been quick to note the revolutionary 
potential of Bitcoin 2.0 technology, with some even believing that it 
represents the coming of a decentralized autonomous society in which 
humans are freed from centralized forms of power and control. Influenced
 by neoliberal theory, these individuals are implicitly working on the 
assumption that ‘freedom' means freedom from the state. This neglects 
that the state can also provide freedom from the vagaries of the market 
by protecting certain things from commodification. Through an analysis 
of (1) class and the role of the state; (2) the concentration and 
centralization of capital; and (3) automation, I argue that the vision 
of freedom that underpins Bitcoin 2.0 tech is one that neglects the 
power that capital holds over us. In neglecting this power, I claim that
 this technology might be far more dystopian than we comprehend, making 
possible societies that are commodities all the way down.</td>

 institutions on the need of regulatory intervention in this area, and 
it points out pressing questions to be tackled by further research.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The rise of Bitcoin and related digital currencies has been 
accompanied by a proliferation of discourse about these technologies, 
including debates about their value and status as forms of money. This 
dissertation examines digital currency discourse from a rhetorical 
perspective, and traces the development and impact of a key trope of 
early Bitcoin discourse—the application of commodity money rhetoric to 
Bitcoin—to understand the rhetorical construction of Bitcoin. It argues 
that early attempts to establish Bitcoin as a form of money, which 
figured Bitcoin as a "natural" entity beyond the reach of community 
politics, produced an unanticipated rhetorical fallout: the displacement
 of the politics of the Bitcoin community onto the development of 
Bitcoin as a technology. It further argues that this early displacement 
continues to influence the rhetorical dynamics of Bitcoin and its heirs 
by shaping subsequent debates over digital currency governance and 
valuation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In recent years the development of cryptocurrencies and wider 
implementations of blockchain technology have been valourized as 
digitally decentralized networks that dissipate control evenly among 
their peers. With Bitcoin, the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency, 
monetary policy is enacted via software built through an open source 
consensus model. This promotes a techno-decentralist ideology that 
promises to democratize societies by eradicating centralized points of 
control in economic systems. Contrastingly, this paper demonstrates how 
Bitcoin's production process operates through strict authoritative 
channels. The overall political framework for altering the Bitcoin code 
is described as senatorial governance: a (de)centralized model of 
bureaucratic parties who compete to change the monetary policy (codified
 rules) of the protocol. This model shows how Bitcoin is not an 
autonomous system but is assembled and maintained via human discretion.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>We offer the first informed comparison of two regional mutual 
credit systems-Sardex and Liberex-aimed at sustaining the local economy.
 Building on previous research on Sardex, we develop an equivalent 
qualitative research investigating both organizers and members of the 
local circuit in Emilia Romagna. Within a theoretical framework that 
considers money as a social institution, socially and politically 
con-structed, we first give an overview of the plurality of existing 
money pointing out a heated debate over the nature of money itself. 
Then, we move to evaluate whether the same monetary architecture-adopted
 by the two mutual credit systems-concretely comes with a similar social
 life. We confirm how social life of money is strictly intertwined with 
its monetary architecture by design, and discover how deeply it is also 
rooted in the institutional and relational contexts where it concretely 
operates. Money differs not only by nature and design, but also by 
context.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The emerging blockchain technology is expected to contribute 
to the transformation of ownership, government services and global 
supply chains. By analysing a crisis that occurred with one of its 
frontrunners, Ethereum, in this article I explore the discrepancies 
between the purported governance of blockchains and the de facto control
 of them through expertise and reputation. Ethereum is also thought to 
exemplify libertarian techno-utopianism. When ‘The DAO', a highly 
publicized but faulty crowd-funded venture fund was deployed on the 
Ethereum blockchain, the techno-utopianism was suspended, and developers
 fell back on strong network ties. Now that the blockchain technology is
 seeing an increasing uptake, I shall also seek to unearth broader 
implications of the blockchain for the proliferation or blockage of 
global finance and beyond. Contrasting claims about the disruptive 
nature of the technology, in this article I show that, by redeeming the 
positive utopia of ontic, individualized debt, blockchains reinforce our
 belief in a crisis-ridden, financialized capitalism.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper analyzes two cases of space tokenization, Meridio 
and QuantmRE, to explore the potential of tokenization as a new means of
 space financialization. Space tokenization is based on blockchain 
technology and security token offering (STO). Although some financial 
geographers noted the possible impact of blockchain technology on space 
financialization, it has not been examined in depth. Therefore, this 
paper demonstrates space tokenization cases in detail. Meridio and 
QuantmRE suggest financial structures that convert space into tokens 
based on fractional ownership transactions. QuantmRE, specifically, 
allows a homeowner to secure cash without either debt or ownership 
relinquishment through sales of tokenized home equity. As this method 
takes a form of sale transaction rather than a loan, it enables 
financial institutions to circumvent strengthened regulation on loans 
after the 2008 global financial crisis. Moreover, even "house poor" 
households, who own houses but lack cash due to excessive loans, can 
cash out from their properties through QuantmRE. As such, space 
tokenization enables financial institutions to overcome constrained 
conditions after the global financial crisis, thereby reproducing space 
financialization. Space tokenization also has the potential to 
geographically expand space financialization through stimulating 
investment in the depressed housing market.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper examines Bitcoin from a legal and regulatory 
perspective, answering several important questions. We begin by 
explaining what Bitcoin is, and why it matters. We describe problems 
with Bitcoin as a method of implementing a cryptocurrency. This 
introduction to cryptocurrencies allows us eventually to ask the 
inevitable question: Is it legal? What are the regulatory responses to 
the currency? Can it be regulated? We make clear why virtual currencies 
are of interest, how self-regulation has failed, and what useful lessons
 can be learned. Finally, we produce useful and semi-permanent findings 
into the usefulness of virtual currencies in general, blockchains as a 
means of mining currency, and the profundity of Bitcoin as compared with
 the development of block chain technologies. We conclude that though 
Bitcoin may be the equivalent of Second Life a decade later, so 
blockchains may be the equivalent of Web 2.0 social networks, a truly 
transformative social technology.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Electronic money is a compound of currency and technology 
which takes its rise around 1970 while benefiting at the same time from 
the miniaturization in electronics and the democratization of 
informatics. Electronic money covers the payment cards with magnetic 
tape, chip cards, the contact-less payments by card, mobile phone, or 
tablet PC, and the logical moneys (often called ‘virtual moneys' such as
 the Bitcoin, the Litecoin, the PPCoin, the Ven, the Linden dollar, the 
‘gold' as in the digital game World of Warcraft). These forms of 
electronic moneys have three common properties: the cryptography, the 
network, and the privileges. Cryptography conditions the ways to access 
the money. The network represents the kind of regulation of electronic 
moneys. The privileges differentiate the use of electronic moneys. Each 
form of electronic money does not match these three conditions 
identically because all are not equipped with the same technologies and 
the same related services. Nevertheless, the presence of these three 
properties within all forms of electronic money leads to a better 
understanding of how such functionalized money deeply changes our view 
on modern society. Indeed, whereas the economic standard model considers
 money as a veil hiding economic reality, the case of electronic money 
lets us think, on the contrary, since the swell period of the early 
1970s, of the real economy as veiling socio-economic reality, which has 
to be considered as a kind of a Ponzi scheme. While this scheme becomes 
the core of societal reality, the economic laws and their sociological 
as well as political equivalents, functional differentiation, and 
democracy are no longer the pillars of modernity. They hide this reality
 as fetishes enabling its order.</td>

						<td>Bitcoin is designed as a peer-to-peer cash system. To work as a
 currency, it must be stable or be backed by a government. In this 
paper, we show that the volatility of Bitcoin prices is extreme and 
almost 10 times higher than the volatility of major exchange rates (US 
dollar against the euro and the yen). The excess volatility even 
adversely affects its potential role in portfolios. Our analysis implies
 that Bitcoin cannot function as a medium of exchange and has only 
limited use as a risk-diversifier. In contrast, we use the deflationary 
design of Bitcoin as a theoretical basis and demonstrate that Bitcoin 
displays store of value characteristics over long horizons.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article explores the changing infrastructural 
architecture of global finance through the lens of Global Production 
Networks (GPNs). Financial markets infrastructure (FMI) for 
international payments and securities trading form the backbone of 
global finance. However, this FMI is typically hidden from observation, 
debate, and analysis, partly because international payments have 
functioned in broadly the same way for almost 50 years, governed by 
large global banks and the co-operative Society for Worldwide Interbank 
Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). A global monopoly sensitive to 
geo-political upheavals, SWIFT is increasingly influential in acting to 
the benefit of the world's most powerful financial and political 
players. Thus, more than a mere passive facilitator of global economic 
activity, we argue in this paper that FMI forms a carefully crafted 
socio-economic system of geo-political relevance, whose core components 
‘power' and ‘embeddedness' we seek to comprehend with the GPN framework.
 We introduce SWIFT as a key player in global FMI and establish a 
conceptual dialogue between the recently introduced notion of the GPNs 
of finance and the newly developed idea of the GPNs of financial 
infrastructure. Incorporating Allen's (1997) power dimensions, we 
demonstrate their coexistence and complementarity in their carefully 
orchestrated, tightly intertwined global organizational arrangements. We
 show that SWIFT's proneness to technological and organizational change 
threatens to reconfigure long-established actors, processes and 
relationships in and beyond finance, and argue that this makes an 
in-depth understanding of FMI vital.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain systems afford new privacy capabilities. This 
threatens to create conflict, as different social groups involved in 
blockchain development often disagree on which capabilities specific 
systems should enact. This article adopts a boundary object perspective 
to make sense of disagreements between collaborating social worlds. We 
perform a case study of privacy attitudes among collaborating actors in 
Monero, a cryptocurrency community that emphasises privacy and 
decentralisation alongside a set of values sometimes described as 
anti-establishment, crypto-anarchist, and/or cypherpunk. The case study 
performs a series of interviews with users, developers, cryptographic 
researchers, corporate architects, and government regulators. Three 
novel and important findings emerge. The first is that none of the 
social worlds express a desire to monitor routine transactions, despite 
the obvious business and tax-collection value of such data. The second 
is that regulators are happy to postpone active involvement, based on 
the flawed assumption they can impose privacy-related regulation later, 
once risks have become clear. Such regulation may not be possible as 
protocols and rulesets currently being coded into the system may be 
impossible to amend in the future (unless they can obtain either 
developer or network consensus). The third is that regulators assume 
methods for overseeing extraordinary transaction are necessary to avoid 
widespread, near-effortless money laundering. Yet, each of the other 
social worlds is operating under the assumption that this trade-off has 
already been accepted. These findings demonstrate subtle power 
transitions and changes in privacy attitudes that have implications for 
research on blockchain, management, and boundary objects in general.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In response to the bleak prospects of today's financial 
markets, a wave of financial and technological innovations emerges, 
bringing about potential benefits but also new challenges. For instance,
 tokenized securities are a new kind of blockchain-based asset enabling 
price stability, programmability, pseudonymity, and transaction 
efficiency, while also introducing new regulatory challenges and 
uncertainties. Conversely, index funds are an established investment 
device enabling broad diversification in a cost-effective, 
tax-efficient, and transparent way, while potentially also contributing 
to concentration of market power, intermediation cost, access barriers 
for underbanked or impoverished investors, increased market volatility, 
and human behavioral challenges. This paper conceptually develops 
Tokenized Index Funds as a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of
 tokenized securities and index funds while alleviating some of their 
drawbacks. Based thereupon, a corresponding multidisciplinary research 
framework is presented, with sample research questions along the 
activities of design and features, business and economics, management 
and organization, and law and regulation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Markets for unique digital property-digital equivalents of 
rare artworks, collectible trading cards, and other assets that gain 
value from scarcity-have exploded in the past several months. At root is
 the next iteration of blockchain technology, unique digital assets 
called non-fungible tokens. Unlike Bitcoin, where one coin is the same 
as another, NFTs are unique, each with different attributes. An NFT that
 represented ownership of Boardwalk would be quite different from one 
that represented Baltic Avenue. NFTs have grown from a few early 
breakout successes to a rapidly developing market for unique digital 
treasures. The attraction to buyers is that unlike digital assets like 
e-books or licensed movies, NFTs can be bought, sold, displayed, gifted,
 or even destroyed just like personal property. Yet law has not kept 
pace with demand for unique digital property. In particular, the rules 
designed for the 2000s internet focused on expanding intellectual 
property licenses and online contracts to the point that we are mere 
users, not owners, of digital assets. This article proposes a clear path
 for the evolution of the legal underpinnings of NFTs. It argues that 
NFTs are personal property, not contracts (despite the "smart contracts"
 popular nomenclature) or pure intellectual property licenses (despite 
the currently governing law of digital assets like e-books). Because 
transactions in NFTs are in the form of a sale, the law of sales of 
personal property should apply. And finally, the article notes </td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This thesis project was intended to take an exploratory look 
at blockchain technology using an interdisciplinary social lens. Drawing
 on a variety of sources, including Actor-Network Theory, multiplicity, 
prefigurative politics, Marx's early writings on technology, and 
ideological aspects of both hacker culture and free and open source 
software development, a complex but useful theoretical framework is 
proposed. Using a multiple methodological approach combining digital 
ethnography, semi-structured interviews, and content analysis, social 
aspects of the blockchain space are explored and an initial first 
description of demographics and characteristics of the blockchain 
community is proposed. The thesis finds that the utilization of 
blockchain technology is playing out in many ways, and there are widely 
varying positions taken from different groups on development and 
essential technological characteristics as well as potential 
motivations. The blockchain area is rapidly evolving, and interest from 
institutions has been growing. Given the potential prefigurative 
attributes of the space, there is the potential for institutional and 
capitalist interests to co-opt and integrate within the space, but this 
could stand to fundamentally change the uses of the technology. The 
thesis concludes that it is absolutely imperative that social scientists
 begin to think seriously about this technological development and its 
social characteristics and implications prior to widespread and 
institutional adoption.</td>

						<td>Money underpins everyone's daily life. Possible solutions for 
the global problems fail if there is not enough money. Yet changes to 
our monetary system are rarely included in the discussion. Against this 
backdrop, cryptocurrencies create important new precedents regarding how
 money can be created. Libra is a recent cryptocurrency project launched
 by one of the dominant social media companies, which has been the 
subject of intense international discussion. Because the details of 
Libra are not yet fully specified, we present different scenarios of how
 a successful Libra currency might play out and some of the problems 
that might follow. These scenarios include the monetization of the 
payment infrastructure, (ab)use of sanctioning power, a reduction of the
 reserve ratio, and an abandonment of reconvertability. These problems 
suggest a number regulatory strategies in response. Finally, we describe
 values and design requirements that might help guide future 
cryptocurrency innovation and provide ways of evaluating their success 
or failure.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Global digital platforms are conquering the world and rely 
critically on digital infrastructures to function, yet little research 
has explored the fundamental interrelationship between the two. This 
working paper argues that understanding centralization and 
decentralization in digital networks as asymmetry and symmetry in mutual
 interdependencies between the constitutive elements of a digital 
network can help us understand the platform-infrastructure relationship 
more fundamentally (and vice versa). To this end, the paper proposes, as
 a starting point, the in-depth analytical and literature study of 
blockchain networks as a particularly revealing type of digital 
platform/infrastructure duality. The paper proposes an analytical model 
for characterizing de/centralization in digital networks and maps this 
onto blockchain networks. Based on this, the paper explores the 
de/centralization of blockchain, arguing that the extant blockchain 
literature largely has failed in providing a comprehensive understanding
 of de/centralization by not considering the complex second-order 
interdependencies between the different constitutive dimensions of a 
blockchain: the symbolic, technological and political dimension. Based 
on this, the paper provides an analysis of the meaning of 
de/centralization in blockchain networks by studying the 
interdependencies between its constitutive elements of coin, network 
technology, and social community.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Many public institutions, government bodies, municipalities 
are experimenting with blockchain based systems, decentralized ledgers, 
smart contracts to deliver new innovative services to citizens, or 
improve the speed, efficiency, accuracy of existing ones. This short 
policy analysis looks at the potential mismatch between usually 
high-trust public institutions, and trust-minimizing technological 
infrastructures. We warn that, in general, we should avoid replacing a 
high-trust environment with a trust-minimizing technology. Pre-existing 
trust is very valuable, and no new technology should endanger trust 
which is extremely hard to build but very easy to destroy. Of course, 
not all institutions enjoy the trust of the citizenry. In low-trust 
environments the implementation of trust minimizing technologies need to
 consider the relative benefits and harms of the different approaches to
 dealing with low-trust environments. One can decide to implement a 
technology that is able to operate in such low-trust settings. The 
alternative to this is to try to implement technologies and policies 
that foster the emergence of trust. What is the preferable way forward: 
replacing distrusted public entities with trust-minimizing technologies,
 or improving their trustworthiness? Should we implement a 
trust-minimizing architecture, or a trust-maximizing one? Our 
institutions may be imperfect, and often produce arbitrary outcomes; 
sometimes they are downright oppressive. But at least there are clear 
lines of social, public, institutional, political and economic 
accountability and oversight. Such mechanisms of trust are yet to mature
 with regard to blockchain technologies. Unless these technologies can 
be brought into the fold, they remain largely unaccountable, thus 
fundamentally untrustworthy. And even if they are, we still don't know 
which is preferable: a polycentric system of power of checks and 
balances, which involves democratic oversight, or an ideally 
decentralized and disintermediated one, where power concentration is 
prevented? This should be a warning to well-intentioned public servants,
 institutions and private actors who are looking at implementing 
blockchain systems in order to better their domain or be seen as 
innovative, or simply because they fear missing out on a technology 
development sold to them as a revolution. It may be worth their while 
not to rush. It is OK to be slow and cautious. Disruptive digital 
innovation that targets trust should be treated with extreme caution.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The blockchain could be the most consequential development in 
information technology since the internet. Created to support the 
Bitcoin digital currency, the blockchain is actually something deeper: A
 novel solution to the age-old human problem of trust. Its potential is 
extraordinary. Yet without effective governance, this approach may not 
promote trust at all. Wholly divorced from legal enforcement, 
blockchain-based systems may be counterproductive or even dangerous. And
 they are less insulated from the law's reach than it seems. The central
 question is not how to regulate blockchains, but how blockchains 
regulate. They may supplement, complement, or substitute for legal 
enforcement. Excessive or premature application of rigid legal 
obligations will stymie innovation and forego opportunities to leverage 
technology to achieve public policy objectives. Blockchain developers 
and legal institutions can work together. Each must recognize the unique
 affordances of the other system.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article departs from the post 2008 financial crisis 
context, from its intersection with technological developments, and from
 the socio-technical arrangements configured by this conjuncture. It 
explores plans and actions – of mainstream financial institutions, and 
of a community seeking for alternatives to centralised economy and 
governance – for the use of digital platforms supported by blockchain 
infrastructure. In particular, it explores how such plans and actions 
relate to conceptions of public and peer trust and how they appear to 
produce, or reinforce, reputational imaginaries and quantification 
practices within added value philosophies. By illuminating a tension 
between the two identified case examples, I seek to render alternative 
communities' and financial institutions' conceptions, imaginaries and 
practices (more) visible and to analyse their organisational marketing 
strategies – where there is a pragmatic and discursive 
operationalisation of technology as well as of trust as means to gain 
more self-sovereignty in action, while navigating markets and regulated 
actual world contexts.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain technology emerged in 2008 in the midst of the 
financial crisis to provide a decentralized alternative to financial 
institutions. Members of the blockchain community, including the 
pseudonymous inventor of the technology Satoshi Nokamoto, have often 
expressed low levels of trust toward traditional institutions such as 
central banks. In contrast, they argue that blockchain technology 
applications such as cryptocurrencies or decentralized autonomous 
organisations do not require the intervention of a third party and are 
therefore more trustworthy while also allowing for more freedom. In this
 context, members of the blockchain community are often described as 
trustless and libertarian. In this study, we tested whether members of 
the blockchain community indeed are different from the general 
population in terms of their attitudes toward trust, politics, science 
and the environment. We found that the blockchain community is less 
trusting of people and institutions, favors more private poverty, and is
 less pro-environmental than the general population. Given that trust in
 institutions has been decreasing in recent years, decentralized systems
 powered by blockchain technology may become appealing to a growing 
number of people around the world.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Scarce and niche in the literature just a few years ago, the 
blockchain topic is now the main subject in conference papers and books.
 However, the hype generated by the technology and its potential 
implications for real-world applications is flawed by many 
misconceptions about how it works and how it is implemented, creating 
faulty thinking or overly optimistic expectations. Too often, 
characteristics such as immutability, transparency, and censorship 
resistance, which mainly belong to the bitcoin blockchain, are sought in
 regular blockchains, whose potential is barely comparable. Furthermore,
 critical aspects such as oracles and their role in smart contracts 
receive few literature contributions, leaving results and theoretical 
implications highly questionable. This literature review of the latest 
papers in the field aims to give clarity to the blockchain oracle 
problem by discussing its effects in some of the most promising 
real-world applications. The analysis supports the view that the more 
trusted a system is, the less the oracle problem impacts.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Die Blockchain-Technologie erfuhr die Spitze ihres ersten 
großen Hypes im Jahr 2017. Bei der Blockchain-Technologie handelt es 
sich um ein dezentrales elektronisches Register für digitale 
Transaktionen. Zu den Eigenschaften der Technologie zählen u. a. eine 
hohe Manipulationsresistenz, welche Vertrauen in digitale Daten erzeugen
 kann, sowie die Möglichkeit, Prozesse und Transaktionen, ohne 
Intermediär abzuwickeln. Diese besonderen Eigenschaften ermöglichen die 
Entstehung eines "Internets der Werte". Während Kryptowährungen den 
bekanntesten Anwendungsfall darstellen (oft auch "digitale Währungen" 
oder "Krypto-Token" genannt), sind seit der Einführung der Technologie 
im Jahr 2008 viele weitere Anwendungsfälle diskutiert worden. Dabei 
bietet sich die Technologie nicht als Universallösung für jegliche 
Problemstellungen an. Das nachfolgende Diskussionspapier soll aufzeigen,
 in welchen Branchen sich die Technologie bereits etabliert hat, welche 
allgemeinen Missverständnisse die Technologie umgeben und wo ihre 
energiewirtschaftlichen Einsatzmöglichkeiten liegen. Zudem soll 
aufgezeigt werden, welche technologieunabhängigen Hürden den Einsatz der
 Technologie erschweren.</td>

						<td>Despite the past decade's rapid innovation in adapting 
blockchain technology to new uses, financial intermediation remains 
elusive except in basic and highly collateralized forms. We introduce 
the concept of the technical frontier to delimit the kinds of 
interactions that can feasibly be structured algorithmically among 
pseudonymous agents, as on a blockchain, and show that lending and 
financial intermediation – unlike monetary exchange – lie outside it, 
even in simple forms. The path forward for truly blockchain-native 
financial applications, therefore, must involve the integration of 
real-world identity information in order to disincentivize defection. We
 discuss several potential technologies for doing so, and conclude that 
such integration is possible without compromising pseudonymity, provided
 real-world identity is available in the breach.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Cryptomining, the clearing of cryptocurrency transactions, 
uses large quantities of electricity. We document that cryptominers' use
 of local electricity implies higher prices for existing small 
businesses and households. Studying the electricity market in Upstate NY
 and using the Bitcoin price as an exogenous shifter of the supply curve
 faced by the community, we estimate the electricity demand functions 
for small businesses and households, and find price elasticities of 
-0.17 and -0.07 respectively. Based on our estimates, we calculate 
counterfactual electricity bills, finding that small businesses and 
households paid $79 million and $165 million extra annually in Upstate 
NY because of increased electricity consumption from cryptominers. Using
 data on China, where prices are fixed, we find that rationing of 
electricity in cities with cryptomining entrants deteriorates wages and 
investments, consistent with crowding-out effects on the local economy. 
Local governments in both Upstate NY and China, however, realize more 
business taxes, but only offsetting a small portion of the costs from 
higher community electricity bills. Our results point to a yet-unstudied
 negative spillover from technology processing to local communities, 
which would need to be considered against welfare benefits</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The article is a case study of several digitally based schemes
 recently operating in Finland where some functions and properties of 
money are evident. While working effectively as designed, they do not 
fully meet the criteria of a well-functioning community currency. The 
schemes include: sysmä, a digitally based hyperlocal system of account 
introduced by the rural Sysmä municipality; Pisteet kotiin®, a housing 
association points system in the city of Tampere, copied from a working 
Dutch model; BookMooch, a global book-swapping site that has extended 
its operations throughout Fin-land. Explored in the article are the 
institutional enabling and inhibitory factors and implications for and 
from other community currency projects. Data was collected by 
participant observation and semi-structured interviews in all schemes. 
Additional media surveying, internet webscrapes and online surveying 
supplemented this data. Along with the demarcation problem between 
currency and money, the technical issues about scale and purpose, if 
such schemes are to develop their offerings to become fully fledged 
currencies, are considered. The concept of "current-see" proposed by the
 MetaCurrency Project, is used as a lens to evaluate if the schemes 
achieve their purpose and whether further development is desirable or 
possible. The concept of a proto-community currency is developed.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Blockchain technologies have generated enthusiasm, yet their 
potential to enable new forms of governance remains largely unexplored. 
Two confronting standpoints dominate the emergent debate around 
blockchain-based governance: discourses characterized by the presence of
 techno-determinist and market-driven values, which tend to ignore the 
complexity of social organization; and critical accounts of such 
discourses which, while contributing to identifying limitations, 
consider the role of traditional centralized institutions as inherently 
necessary to enable democratic forms of governance. In this article, we 
draw on Ostrom's principles for self-governance of communities to 
explore the transformative potential of blockchain beyond such 
standpoints. We approach blockchain through the identification and 
conceptualization of six affordances that this technology may provide to
 communities: tokenization, self-enforcement and formalization of rules,
 autonomous automatization, decentralization of power over the 
infrastructure, increasing transparency, and codification of trust. For 
each affordance, we carry out a detailed analysis situating each in the 
context of Ostrom's principles, considering both the potentials of 
algorithmic governance and the importance of incorporating communities' 
social practices into blockchain-based tools to foster forms of 
self-governance. The relationships found between these affordances and 
Ostrom's principles allow us to provide a perspective focused on 
blockchain-based commons governance.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper is based on research among blockchain communities 
in the Netherlands and online terrains. Through an empirical example, it
 explores tales produced by projects based on the blockchain protocol 
and on the premise that cryptocurrencies are money and that money has 
generative potential for social and economic change. By unpacking the 
pragmatics of a particular project–Bitnation and Pangea – I argue that 
despite tales of decentralisation through the moneyness of 
cryptocurrencies, and the distributed and automated character of the 
blockchain protocol, these currencies, and projects, are deeply 
entangled with fiat and mainstream economies and markets. This is 
visible by looking at the ups and downs of cryptocurrency pricing and on
 the effects this volatility has on (certain) projects. The lack of a 
sustainable community of trust in cryptocurrencies as money – 
particularly visible in initiatives following more libertarian and 
utopian tales, detached from everyday life realities – and the way these
 retain attention mainly due to speculation, have very real effects for

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>New currencies designed for user anonymity and privacy–widely 
referred to as “privacy coins”–have forced governments to listen and 
legislate, but the political motivations of these currencies are not 
well understood. Following the growing interest of political brands in 
different contexts, we provide the first systematic review of political 
motivations expressed in cryptocurrency whitepapers whose explicit goal 
is “privacy.” Many privacy coins deliberately position themselves as 
alternative political brands. Although cryptocurrencies are often 
closely associated with political philosophies that aim to diminish or 
subvert the power of governments and banks, advocates of privacy occupy 
much broader ideological ground. We present thematic trends within the 
privacy coin literature and identify epistemic and ethical tensions 
present within the communities of people calling for the adoption of 
entirely private currencies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>WikiLeaks is a controversial organisation that attracts 
polarised responses. This is not unexpected given its key objective of 
exposing the secrets and social control ambitions of the powerful. While
 its supporters laud its pursuit of an informational commons, its 
detractors condemn its antisocial character, its megalomania-and its 
anarchism. It is the latter that particularly interests us here. This 
paper treats the "charge" of anarchism seriously, however, giving it the
 analytical attention it warrants. It does this by first identifying 
those characteristics of the organisation that would render it 
anarchist, and then to conceptualise what this anarchism means. It 
highlights two important elements of the WikiLeaks story: the anarchical
 character of the technologies it utilises to foment its dissent; and 
the anarchical ethos of the organisation's radical politics. We conclude
 by also considering the tensions and contradictions in WikiLeaks that 
temper both its anarchism and its social change objectives. © 2012 The

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In a historical review focused on digital piracy, we explore 
the relationship between hacker politics and the state. We distinguish 
between two core aspects of piracy-the challenge to property rights and 
the challenge to state power-and argue that digital piracy should be 
considered more broadly as a challenge to the authority of the state. We
 trace generations of peer-to-peer networking, showing that digital 
piracy is a key component in the development of a political platform 
that advocates for a set of ideals grounded in collaborative culture, 
nonhierarchical organization, and a reliance on the network. We assert 
that this politics expresses itself in a philosophy that was formed 
together with the development of the state-evading forms of 
communication that perpetuate unmanageable networks.</td>
