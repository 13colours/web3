# Pyramid Scheme
A pyramid scheme is a fraudulent investment based on recruiting an ever-increasing number of "investors" or [greater fools](greater-fool-theory.md) into the scheme. The initial promoters recruit investors, who in turn recruit more investors, and so on. 

See [multilevel marketing scheme](mlm.md).
