# Gold Standard

A monetary standard based on precious metals, espoused as [[sound-money]] in [[austrian-economics]].

## Criticisms

* Unequal distribution of gold across Earth gives certain countries and groups unequal access to value detached from economic activity and based purely on geography.
* Limits the amount of economic growth because supply is limited. 
* Does not allow market intervention during recessions.
* Short-term price volatility
* Deflationary currencies encourage hording and punish debtors.
* Gold mining and production is not predictable on long time scales.
