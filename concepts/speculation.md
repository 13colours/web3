# Speculation
Speculation is the taking of a position on an asset with the hope that it will become more valuable on a short time horizon. Speculation plays a part in [price formation](price-formation.md).

Some speculators may care little for the [fundamental value](fundamental-value.md) of the asset and instead focus purely on short-term price movements, public sentiment and momentum.
