# Bubble
An economic bubble is a phenomenon in [markets](market.md) created by herd mentality, whereby people hear stories of others who bought in early and made big profits, causing those who did not buy to feel a fear of missing out. This causes irrational pricing of the asset which proceeds until the mania subsides.

Attempting to time the market on bubbles is a [zero-sum game](zero-sum-game.md) and has a negative [expected return](expected-return.md).

See ["madness of crowds"](madness-crowds.md), [market mania](market-mania.md) and [bandwagon bias](bandwagon-bias.md).
