# Mining
The technical process of confirming transactions in a [blockchain](blockchain.md) using the proof of work [consensus-algorithm](consensus-algorithm.md). Mining is typically centralized by companies known as mining pools which pool physical compute resources in order to increase their probability of confirming blocks.

Mining is an energy intensive process with a large environmental footprint.
