# Distribution Problem
The *distribution problem* refers to a set of hypothetical solutions to achieve a equitable (or other property) of distribution in the bootstrapping of a [private-money](private-money.md). Effectively how to distribute the [currency](currency.md) to early adopters to achieve some end.

An alleged solution to this problem comes attached to a presuppositional claim about what *equity* would be defined as, which is a political rather than economic claim.
