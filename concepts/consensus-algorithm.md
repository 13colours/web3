# Consensus Algorithm

A mechanism by which data is synchronised across computer and kept in a consistent state.

## Proof of Work

An algorithm where blocks in the blockchain are validated by the consumption of physical resources (energy, compute cycles) to solve hash-function inversion problems to create a global sortition function.

## Proof of Stake

An algorithm where blocks in the blockchain are validated by the staking of on-chain assets to provide a weighted global sortition function where virtual wealth corresponds to probabilistic governance.

## Proof of Authority

An algorithm where blocks in the blockchain are validated by a closed and fixed set of pre-selected authorities which confirm transactions via quorum voting. Often uses mechanisms from classical computer science algorithms such as Paxos and Raft.

## Proof of Space

An algorithm where blocks in the blockchain are validated by the consumption of digital resources such as random access memory or disk space. The global sortition functions weighted based on the size and availability of these digital space resources.

## Hashgraphs
