# Technocollectivism
A loose set of political or organisational ideologies that [blockchain](../blockchain.md), [crypto assets](../cryptoasset.md) and [DAOs](../dao.md) can be used to enable new forms of organisations in which capital formation can occur outside of existing power structures. These include a variety of experiments in social choice theory, futarchy and digital cooperatives.
