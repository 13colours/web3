# Financial Nihilism
A philosophy on investing and markets in which [value](../value.md) does not exist or is inherently unknowable. The claims of this ideology are inherently contradictory but is stems from an underlying belief that [market](../market.md) have no purpose and cannot or do not exist to do [price formation](../price-formation.md) on [assets](../assets.md) because [capitalism](capitalism.md) does not work.

This is a belief system held by many who participate in [meme-stock](../meme-stock.md) and [memecoin](memecoin) projects such as [dogecoin](../dogecoin.md).
