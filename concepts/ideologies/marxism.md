# Marxism
A political ideology rooted in the ideas of Karl Marx which asserts the inherent intellectual contradictions at the heart of [capitalism](capitalism.md) and [market](../market.md). Marx defines a heterodox reading of [value](../value.md) based on philosophy and history and attempts to derive a new system in which [price-formation](../price-formation.md) can occur without the existing superstructure of capitalism.
