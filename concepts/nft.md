# Non Fungible Token
A type of [smart contracts](smart-contracts.md) that associates a tradable [crypto asset](cryptoasset.md) with a unique piece of data, often a url to hosted image representing some abstract or perceived notion of ownership in [art](art.md) or [sign value](sign-value.md). Since the tokens have "unique" data associated with the token it is non-fungible unlike other crypto assets which aspire to be a fungible [private money](private-money.md).

NFTs at their most basic conceptual core are a hyperlink or URL that is itself sold as a tradeable asset where the connection between the concepts of the URL and the [ficticious commodity](ficticious-commodity.md) is generated by the [Tinkerbell effect](tinkerbell-effect.md).

NFTs have been critizied as having a payout structure similar to a [pyramid scheme](pyramid-scheme.md) or [multilevel marketing scheme](mlm.md).

NFTs have been critizied as being a [bubble](bubble.md).

NFTs have no [use value](use-value.md).

NFTs have no [fundamental value](fundamental-value.md).

NFTs are a [speculative asset](speculation.md).

NFTs have no [income cashflows](income-cashflows.md).
