# Derivative
A derivative is a type of financial contract whose value is dependent on an *underlying* asset, basket of assets, or a benchmark of other assets.

Underlying for derivatives are most often [stocks](stock.md), [bonds](bond.md), [commodites](commodity.md), [currencies](currency.md), debt and market indexes. The value of the contract itself depend on changes in the prices of the underlying asset. 

A derivative is a type of [financial asset](financial-asset.md). Derivatives have no [use value](use-value.md). Their [fundamental value](fundamental-value.md) and demand is generated from their the demand of the underlying.
