# Artificial Scarcity

The abstract notion of creating an asset which has no physicality or underlying and whose demand curve is not generated by [use-value](use-value.md) or [income-cashflows](income-cashflows.md). 

Financial instruments like bonds, stocks and derivatives are not artificially scarce because of their underlying cashflows. Commodities are not artificially scarce because of their physicality and intrinsic value.

Products like [crypto asset](cryptoasset.md) and [nft](nft.md) are artificially scarce.
