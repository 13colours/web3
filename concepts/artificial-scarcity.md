# Artificial Scarcity

The abstract notion of creating an asset which has no physicality or underlying and whose demand curve is not generated by [use-value](concepts/use-value.md) or [income-cashflows](concepts/income-cashflows.md). 

Financial instruments like bonds, stocks and derivatives are not artificially scarce.

Pseudo-assets like [nft](concepts/nft.md) are artificially scarce.
