# Web3
An umbrella marketing term for a variety of endeavours to integrate [crypto assets](cryptoasset.md), [NFTs](nft.md), [DAOs](dao.md), [DeFi](defi.md) and [smart contracts](smart-contracts.md) into existing web infrastructure.

Web3 has become an intellectual nexus for many internet "thought leaders" to pontificate about grand visions of technical and financial reconfiguration largely detached from any concrete plans or implementations of these ideas. This may give rise to [bubble](bubble.md) detached from any progress on building real companies or technologies.

Web3 has been [criticised](https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/web3-bullshit.html) as being an intentionally ambiguous buzzword with no precise meaning.

Web3 has also been described as a means of doing [regulatory arbitrage](regulatory-arbitrage.md) on [securites](security.md) offerings to enrich venture capital firms.
