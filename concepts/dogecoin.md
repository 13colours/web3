A [[memecoin]] [cryptoasset](cryptoasset.md) based on a joke about the Shibu Inu variety of dogs. 

Dogecoin is an example of a crypto asset with no political imaginaries, no [currency](currency.md) narrative, no pretension of [use-value](use-value.md), no [fundamental-value](fundamental-value.md), and no narrative economics whatsoever. it is a pure manifestation of the [greater-fool-theory](greater-fool-theory.md) with an investment thesis rooted purely in financial nihilism.

Dogecoin is part of a larger class of nihilistic investments based around a collective dog money theme
